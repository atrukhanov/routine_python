00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000000

2
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,520
(sound effects complementing shot transitions)

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,600
Hey, everyone!
We're in the Silicon Valley.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,200
First thing people normally do
when they come here

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,960
is rush to see the famous
Wozniak and Jobs garage.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,400
That's where many years ago,
Apple was created.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,240
But this garage behind me
is much more emblematic.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,520
In the 1930s, it served as
the first office

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,200
for William Hewlett and David Packard,

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,160
two Stanford University graduates
who founded Hewlett-Packard,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,080
one of the first IT giants
in America and the world.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,520
It's believed that this is where
the modern world started.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,920
The Silicon Valley is the place where
they create our everyday conveniences,

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,160
making billions of moneys doing it.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
More and more Russian speakers
arrive here every year.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,720
How do they end up here? What do they do?
And why in America, and not back at home?

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,400
To figure it all out, we stayed
here for almost a week

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,560
and met with a bunch
of different people.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Right. We want to make
an important note here.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,840
The majority of this footage
was shot before the coronavirus.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,120
But this video isn't about who's
the richest or the coolest right now.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,400
This episode is about the value system

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,160
that allowed people to turn
an 80-kilometer stretch of land

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,000
into the technological
capital of the entire world.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,720
This system and these values
are decades-old,

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,600
and it's very likely that even the issues
that befell the world in 2020

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,200
won't be able to change
these values too much.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,000
Besides, the two main points
we were making in this episode

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,000
are unlikely to be affected
by the coronavirus.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,680
The episode you're about to watch
has two main purposes.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,040
First, to remind everyone that even if you
were born and grew up in a small town,

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,120
you can still make it
to the very top.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,880
Second, to prove that making money
is a lot more fun than collecting it.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
(exhales sharply)
Let's go!

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,520
(title card music)

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,320
(airplane sound effect)

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,960
(sound effects complementing shots)

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,280
- (Dud') You live here?
- (Davidov) Yeah. Renting.

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,880
- $10,000 a month?
- Give or take.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,080
Well, you're at least paying
for the view as I understand.

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
Yeah, the house is old.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,200
Old. But what's the average
rate here?

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,520
You won't find anything cheaper
in Los Altos Hills.

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,000
[NIKOLAY DAVIDOV]
[32 years old]
[Co-founder of Gagarin Capital venture firm.]
- Oh. So this is like a down-and-out place.
- Yeah, it's a down-and-outer.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,560
[NIKOLAY DAVIDOV]
[32 years old]
[Co-founder of Gagarin Capital venture firm.]
Okay. What about Mountain View
where we're staying?

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,760
$6,000 minimum.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
A house.
$6,000 a month.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,760
How much do you think it's worth?
We have three bedrooms.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
$2.5 to 3 million.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Three bedrooms is around that.

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,880
Dude, I could kick a hole...

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm no Jean-Claude Van Damme,

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,160
but I could kick a hole in a wall
there just like that.

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,240
Materials cost nothing.
Labor costs a lot.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,120
Minimum wage.

56
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
And...

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,920
meeting requirements.

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,880
No, but land probably costs a lot?

59
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
Land costs a shitton.

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,080
But labor costs the most.

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,440
For example, we recently
had another earthquake.

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,280
One of our sewage pipes
had rotted away and collapsed.

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,720
Water in the kitchen sink
stopped going away.

64
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,200
We called the plumbers.
They went and checked it out.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,920
They gave us a choice of two solutions.
Worth $16,000 and $35,000.

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,480
That's local plumbing bills for you.

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,360
You should've seen their gear!

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
They looked like Ghostbusters.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,400
With the backpacks
and the visors.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,240
The snake with the camera like
the one they use for colonoscopies.

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,160
You know... It was a long pipe.

72
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
We... know what that is.
(Davidov laughs)

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,320
In plain and simple terms,
I help scale businesses.

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,920
I help businesses grow faster than
they would've without me.

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,560
I find a company

76
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,640
that I find promising

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
and start helping them out.

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,960
If they don't currently need money,

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
I can help in other ways.

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,800
But most of the time,
it's investment.

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,640
For example, people might need
a million dollars to finish their product

82
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,120
to get initial revenue
and initial user reviews.

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,520
We serve as the investor
they need.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,440
We make a profit on helping them
then sell their now scaled up company,

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,720
and split the profit with them.

86
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,520
You work in an investment firm

87
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
that you founded with some partners.

88
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,120
You raised some money,

89
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,720
several millions dollars.

90
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,440
You find promising projects
and invest in them.

91
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,720
For example, you give them $100,000
in exchange for 10% of the company.

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,400
- And then your job is to make those 10% worth
$5 million instead of the initial $100,000.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,120
Exactly!

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,440
- Then you split the profit.
Is this essentially what you do?
- Yes.

95
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,360
(Dud') Fazliev.

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,200
(Davidov) Amazing entrepreneur
who made two good companies.

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,080
He got several offers to sell
his company in the last year.

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
He won't tell how much
they offered.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,120
Can you estimate as an expert how much
his company could be worth right now?

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm an insider.

101
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,680
I invested in his company too.

102
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
But it's hundreds of millions
of dollars?

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
Most likely.

104
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
Holy crap.

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,520
Could you explain to people
who don't deal with IT

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,960
- You made your first million at 21, correct?
- Yes.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
How? In short.

115
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,240
Online stores, but they were
different online stores.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,760
Could you hold that million
in your hands at 21?

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,280
Or was it a virtual million,
as is typical for the IT crowd?

[*He actually says he couldn't NOT hold it,]
[but it sounds like a slip of the tongue.]
At 21, I couldn't hold it*.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,080
I remember one of my
biggest amateur mistakes.

120
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,320
There was a competitor company.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,560
They were from LA, California.

122
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,240
They started out as consultants
on my own product, X-Cart,

123
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,480
[X-Cart is Fazliev's first e-commerce startup,]
[created in 2001.]
but later launched their own,
Magento.

124
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,360
[X-Cart is Fazliev's first e-commerce startup,]
[created in 2001.]
Right?

125
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,920
[X-Cart is Fazliev's first e-commerce startup,]
[created in 2001.]
Magento eventually became so big
that they sold it to eBay for $160 million.

126
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,200
Magento eventually became so big
that they sold it to eBay for $160 million.

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,720
When they sold it to eBay
for $160 million,

128
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,840
at that point, they were
smaller than me.

129
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,080
- Let me tell you, I don't have
$160 million.
- Right?

130
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
And this makes me very sad.

131
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,200
There were offers. But I didn't just decline.
I didn't pick up the phone.

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,000
This was a typical thing
in those years.

133
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,920
They'd contact tech support,

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,200
saying: "We wanna...

135
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,600
"We wish to talk to Ruslan."

136
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
"About what?"

137
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,840
"We wish to buy X-Cart."

138
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,160
"Oh, you don't need to talk
to Ruslan to buy X-Cart."

139
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,560
"You need to go to our site,
click whatever, yadda yadda."

140
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
"You don't understand.

00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,600
"the company."

142
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,040
But I didn't talk to them,
because I was young and stupid.

143
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,240
I thought they didn't understand
how this whole affair worked

144
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,040
and wouldn't be able to buy it.

145
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,560

briefcases of money, you know?

- Let's lock this in. A Russian guy...
- Yes.

can't watch YouTube on a big screen?

This way, it's around you,
it's got food.

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,400
This is like another way to tether
people to Google's offices?

166
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,640
Not exactly "tether." It's more like
a comfortable environment

167
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,280
so you don't worry
about trivial shit.

168
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,920
Do you come here?

169
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,880
Of course. I eat here every day.

170
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,560
You're in shape. The guy
from PR is also in shape.

171
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
How do you do it?

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,080
There's so much chow around,
but people somehow stay in shape.

173
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,240
So there's a thing
called Google 15.

174
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,960
When you start at Google, you usually
quickly gain 15 pounds. It's like 7 kilos.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
That's exactly what happened to me.

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,760
You gotta get back in shape
afterward... actively.

177
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,120
There's a gym right over there,
behind the food trucks.

178
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,919
See the next building? That's where
people go to run and lift weights.

179
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
You know?

180
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,800
In my estimate, around 98%,
maybe 99% of employees in Russia

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,600
will see this and raise their brows.

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
They don't know what's the point
of all this free stuff.

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,320
Can you explain?

184
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,000
If you wanna create
something unusual,

185
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
something much greater
than what's predictable,

186
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,800
you need an unusual environment.

187
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,160
You need to create an environment
where people can focus on creating,

188
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,840
inventing,

189
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,840
thinking outside the box,
et cetera.

190
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Each step you take in this direction works
towards your company's capitalization.

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Therefore,

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,760
by reducing the need to think
about all sorts of nonsense,

193
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,160
you increase the amount of time people
can dedicated to solving problems.

194
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,560
Do you though?
Doesn't it relax people?

195
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,800
Well, the thing is, you hire people
whose purpose in life is creating.

196
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,200
They just need the environment.
That's why I'm here.

197
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,840
I just really wanted to do my work

198
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,480
and I found the best
environment to do it

199
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,000
without worrying about
anything else.

200
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,600
This is just inappropriate.

201
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,560
Very much appropriate!
You see...

202
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
Here's the thing.

[and founded Google when they were 25.]
[In early spring of 2020, Forbes estimated Brin's net]

[and founded Google when they were 25.]
[In early spring of 2020, Forbes estimated Brin's net]

they drew inspiration
from their school.

205
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,760
I.e. Stanford.

206
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,000
- You've been there, right?
- Yeah.
- They have courts too.

207
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,320
This is basically the climate
of a college campus:

208
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,160
free exchange of knowledge,

209
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
you're relaxed,
you're a student,

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,600
you can play some volleyball, read some books,
write a report and so on.

211
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,480
Graduates would stream here
to build great things.

212
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,880
They created an environment for them that was
as close as possible to something like Stanford.

213
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,520
The second major influence,
I think, was the Burning Man.

214
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,880
It's a crazy festival that Sergey
and Larry had also gone to.

219
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,600
Like, let's all give as much as possible,
and something great will come out.

220
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
It's basically like
"from each according to his ability,
to each according to his needs."

221
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,280
The more you give,

222
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,120
and if a crowd of people is doing the same,
you'll get something great as a result.

224
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,120
You know what's the hardest part
of editing episodes like this one?

225
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,400
Being reminded that there are
things like airports,

226
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,240
airplanes, flights

227
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,960
and other things that used to take you
to places other than home.

very much.

are this couch

and YouTube that you can
watch on this couch.

231
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,040
Here are two YouTube channels

232
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,360
to help you stay sane
during this quarantine.

233
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,640
The first channel is called Arzamas.

234
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,360
Many will once again make fun of me, saying that
it took me until 2020 to discover internet,

235
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,040
but yes, only in April of this year, I first watched
two great videos on the Arzamas channel:

236
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,640
Ancient Rome in 20 Minutes
and Ancient Greece.

237
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,440
They're history lectures

238
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,040
fitting the year 2020.

239
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,920

rumors about our creative crew was this:

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,000
"Dud' produces the Tender Editor channel."

241
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,240

has only one producer.

the wonderful, tender lady,

who used to be our editor
for the longest time

245
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,240
but then started her own thing.

246
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,320

as the show Girl Friends.

[*Both cameramen of the crew are called Sergey.]
that Seriogas* were also
famous content creators

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,040
and used to make videos
about rope jumping.

easy navigation, intuitive interface
and a wide selection of applications.

Unique and super handy
Ambilight feature.

277
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,080
It's main effect: the picture
appears larger

278
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,080
thanks to Ambilight filling the space
around the TV with a colored halo.

279
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,920
This feature works particularly well at night
if you enjoy watching TV in the dark.

280
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,920
It substantially reduces eye stress.

281
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,440
It also has a special Lounge mode

282
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,520

simply filling the room with mood light.

- Three-story house. Yours.
- Yes.

But it's millions of dollars.

303
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,360
It was much cheaper
than what it costs now,

because I got it
in a really bad condition.

305

307
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,080
Yes. Renovation wasn't cheap either.

308
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,360
- Is it mortgage?
- Yes. I owe money.

309
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,560
If you don't owe anyone,
no one trusts you in America.

First, you need to try and create
something in Medvedkovo.

313

You'll probably end up
with something bad.

314

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,280
- ...if you wanted the Boomer tune on your phone,
you had to do it on Tapok.ru.
- Yes.

324
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,160
And it made you a lot of money.

325
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,480
Not a lot, but some money.

326
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,720
You said you could buy
a car every day?

327
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,560
Not every day. I could buy one
every month.

328
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
- You could buy a new car every month.
- Yes. A shitty one.

329
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,480
- What?
- A shitty car every month.

330
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,560
- After that, you moved to Prague.
- Yes.

331
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
[Doronichev moved to Prague in 2006]
Why?

332
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
[Doronichev moved to Prague in 2006]
Because I realized

333
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,640
I had no one to learn from
how to make something truly big.

334
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,640
I wanted to...

335
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,160
Tapok. ru wasn't much different
from mobile YouTube.

336
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,880
It was a mobile service that
gave you access to content

337
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
like videos, music.

338
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,720
But on old phones.

339
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,880
On old phones. But that's not the point.
The point is that it was...

340
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,080
Essentially the same idea
took the shape of

341
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,840
"Send a short message to..."

342
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,440
This sort of low-scale
business operation

343
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,600
without much of an idea behind it.

344
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,200
When I realized that the same idea

345
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,160
could play a significant role
on a global scale

346
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,240
in how the world operates,

347
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,440
when I saw that this was real,

348
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,040
I realized I couldn't do it
living where I lived at the time.

349
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,959
I recently re-watched this video.

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,120
We had someone film us
at school in 9th grade.

351
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,000
They asked us what
we wanted to do.

352
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,200
I had read some nifty book

353
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,920
and said that I wanted to develop business
strategies for companies for money.

354
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,560
I had little understand of what that meant
at the time, but it sounded cool.

355
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,440
Eventually, it did become my job.
I worked for Cisco.

356
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,920
It's a tech company.

357
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,320
[Cisco is a multinational company that develops]
[network equipment for major organizations]
[and telecommunications firms]
It's a tech company.

358
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,120
[Cisco is a multinational company that develops]
[network equipment for major organizations]
[and telecommunications firms]
Then I went to study
in Scotland, got back

359
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,720
[Cisco is a multinational company that develops]
[network equipment for major organizations]
[and telecommunications firms]
and started trying to launch
various businesses.

360
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,400
[Cisco is a multinational company that develops]
[network equipment for major organizations]
[and telecommunications firms]
Then I realized that...

361
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,360
Then I realized that...

362
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
After another failure, one of my
friends came to me and said:

363
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,560
"I already have a working business."

364
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,920
"Can you help me raise
money to expand?"

365
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
"We have incoming orders."

366
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,600
"We just need the money to produce."

367
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,120
I agreed to help them. I put together a nice
presentation, they got the money.

368
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,360
I thought: cool.

369
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,760
I didn't ask for money, but the way,
but they paid me.

370
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,200
They paid me well over what
I earned in six months.

371
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,600
I thought: "Wow! Why do I even
go to work?"

372
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,880
I continued to do this in the background.
This got me introduced to Sergey Solonin.

373
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,200
My college mate's father
introduced me.

374
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,240
I came to him with
an investment offer.

375
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,640
- He said: "I don't understand this stuff..."
- Sergey Solonin from Qiwi?

376
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,840
Yeah. "You want Serioga. He's smart.
He's into technology. Talk to him."

377
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
[Sergey Solonin, co-founder of the Qiwi mobile]
[payment platform. Net worth according]
[to Forbes-2015 ranking — $400 million]
Yeah. "You want Serioga. He's smart.
He's into technology. Talk to him."

378
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,480
[Sergey Solonin, co-founder of the Qiwi mobile]
[payment platform. Net worth according]
[to Forbes-2015 ranking — $400 million]
I go to the address he gave me, Petrovskiy alley,
and find this super expensive palace.

379
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,760
I go to the address he gave me, Petrovskiy alley,
and find this super expensive palace.

380
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,760
Just... pure luxury.

381
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,760
Expensive pictures on walls.

382
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,280
$100,000 leather couch.

383
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,920
I don't know how much it was worth,
but it looked ridiculous.

384
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,520
Sitting on the couch was this guy
in track pants and a wifebeater,

385
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,160
with greasy hair,
like mine right now,

386
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
and red eyes of someone
who hasn't slept in three days,

387
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,720
reading something.

388
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,200
He checks out my 15-page
presentation,

389
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,920
just flips through it like this, asks three
questions about its weakest points

390
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,880
and says: "Total garbage.
Redo it and come back."

391
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,800
I thought: "Wow. This guy is SMART."

392
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,840
I redid it. Came back.
He checked it out and said:

393
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,600
"Better. I won't give you any money,
but I like you."

394
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,120
"Let's open a fund."

395
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,280
I knew what funds were and how they
worked, 'cause I studied it in college.

396
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,560
I thought my journey to a venture
fund would take ten years.

397
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,120
Instead, it took one
chance meeting.

398
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,560
You moved to Prague?

399
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,280
I moved... elsewhere.
To me, it was all "overseas."

400
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,280
I moved overseas. I moved in search
of a crowd I could learn from.

401
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,640
Prague wasn't the place.

402
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,800
Wait. What was the idea?
You moved:

403
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,920
Charles Bridge,
Staropramen beer...

404
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,920
What did you do over there?

405
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,880
There, I lost the part of me
I was always familiar with.

406
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,480
It was just a way to drag myself
out of my old environment.

407
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,480
- Oh. So you moved elsewhere not
planning to do anything particular?
- Yeah.

408
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,840
No. I moved to work. I moved to learn.
I moved to search.

409
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,520
I just didn't know
where to go yet.

410
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,240
I had the "Muscovite's globe": MKAD,
beyond it, Siberia,
and then the overseas.

411
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,320
More or less.

412
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,920
I didn't know how the Silicon Valley
was different from London

413
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
or how London was
different from Prague.

414
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,720
I just moved elsewhere
to make some sort of step.

415
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,800
If you don't know what to do,
make one step.

416
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,000
You studied there?

417
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,840
No. I tried to start a business.

418
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
Didn't quite work out.

419
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,520
I lost all the money I had
'cause I was stupid.

420
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,920
Ended up in a tough situation...
which is really motivating.

421
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,960
"All the money"
was how much exactly?

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,760
At the time, I had...

423
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,320
Leaving the country,
I had around $100,000.

424
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
How did you lost them?

425
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,080
Bad investment, in Russia.

426
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,400
- In what?
- In my relative's business.

427
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,400
He was doing some shady things.
Didn't work out in the end.

428
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,400
- You said you ate sausage clippings there?
- Yeah, I did.

429
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,160
What are sausage clippings?

430
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
When they slice meats
at the deli counter,

431
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
they end up with end bits.

432
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,360
They actually sell them.

433
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
You can ask if they
have leftovers that...

434
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,880
end pieces of sausage.

435
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
They're sold real cheap.

436
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,400
If you can't afford sausage, you can buy
these clippings. They're much cheaper.

437
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,840
I had a daily budget of 200 rubles
for a family of three people.

438
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
- You said 300.
- Or was it 300?

439
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,800
Yeah, 200 korunas or 300 rubles.
Right.

440
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,640
How did you survive?

441
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,880
Humbly.

442
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,040
Humbly, but with a lot
of determination.

443
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
You know? With a purpose.

444
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
How did Prague lead to Google?

445
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,800
I wrote a letter to Google.

446
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,640
I read books, I wanted to understand.
I moved to learn.

447
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,040
I moved to learn how to create
large-scale products,

448
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,520
how to make something
like iTunes.

449
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,320
iPod had just come out
at the time.

450
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,520
And... I started reading books about
the founders of some major companies:

451
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,720
Dell, Oracle, Microsoft.

452
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
I read one about Google.

453
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,720
And... it blew me away.
I realized that

454
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,600
someone had built a culture
I wanted to build myself.

455
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,600
I had no idea how to build it.

456
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,440
I wanted to learn and I realized that
I wanted to learn from these people.

457
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
So I sent them an email.

458
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,440
- An email?
- Yes.

459
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,120
I sent an email to jobs@google.com

460
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,800
that said

461
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,200
something like: "Guys, you're
neglecting the mobile phones."

462
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840
"Mobile phones are the future."

463
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,760
"Everyone here in Russia
is on mobile phones."

464
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,160
"I know how to do it.
Please, hire me and I'll do it."

465
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,240
They didn't reply. Obviously.

466
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,240
- They didn't reply?
- They didn't.

467
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,240
They didn't reply after a month,
after two months.

468
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,680
I kept looking for contacts
to reach them.

469
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,160
Eventually, they replied.

470
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,160
I couldn't find anyone. They just replied
themselves several months later.

471
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,520
- Sounds kinda unreal.
- Totally.

472
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,240
- Like emailing the Kremlin.
- It was totally unreal.

473
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,080
I don't know of another
story like that.

474
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,360
I still fund it really weird
that it worked out.

475
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
The stars must've aligned.

476
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Why do you think they replied?

477
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
I think I got lucky.

478
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I believe every success
involves a lot of effort,

479
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,560
many failures and the perseverance
to overcome those failures,

480
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,400
but realistically, you'll always
need some luck.

481
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,280
They called me after all
the interviews and said:

482
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,680
"We have a job opening for you,
but it's not in Prague."

483
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
"It's in Dublin."

484
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,640
At that point, it no longer made any difference.
On my globe, they were practically the same.

485
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,080
So I went to Dublin.

486
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
What are these holes?

487
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,160
They're ground squirrels
called gophers.

488
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,560
There's a ton of them out here.

489
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,960
It's the wilds.

490
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,760
They're prey to eagles in the sky,
roaming foxes,

491
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,040
mountain lions and coyotes.

492
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,320
- You warned us not to let your cat out. Why?
- They'll eat him.

493
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,000
Down here, cats... None of ours
ever got eaten, thankfully.

494
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,760
Friends and neighbors lost 'em just like that.
They run away and...

495
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,240
Cats are naturally cocky. If it sees
a raccoon, it'll start a fight with it.

496
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,120
A raccoon will kill a cat
just like that.

497
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Larger animals will too,
mostly coyotes.

498
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,920
How do you let your
kids out to play?

499
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
They don't attack children.

500
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,520
I believe, in the last five years, only one
child got attacked by a mountain lion.

501
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,920
Just don't let your kids
stray too far alone.

502
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,440
They don't come near houses.

503
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,040
If you have a child with you,
you want to pick up the child.

504
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,560
The animal will see you
as a single large entity.

505
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,280
Who lives here besides
your family?

506
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,160
We live on the top floor.

507
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,400
My family, kids.

508
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,760
One the second floor, we have several
business owners, all Russian-speaking.

509
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,160
It's a great little gang.
There's four of them.

510
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,400
On the ground floor, we have
an assorted group of people.

511
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,080
Why are you offering
them shelter?

512
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,360
They're renting.

513
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
- Oh, they pay you money?
- Yeah.

514
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,520
It kinda appears like Erlich's place
from the show Silicon Valley.

515
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,640
(Doronichev laughs)
It does!

516
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,000
Guy offers startuppers housing in exchange
for 10% of their startup's capital.

517
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,640
Do you too take 10%?

518
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,160
No. I agreed to much less.

519
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,760
I put money into one of
the second-floor startups.

520
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,320
I bought some shares from Dumik.
I was one of the first to invest in his Chatfuel.

521
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,760
Only him though.

522
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
So you're just offering
guys shelter?

523
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,640
No. I gave him some money for the company,
I invested in his company,

524
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,880
and also he pays me rent.

525
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,440
I use the money to pay off
the mortgage.

526
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,880
Can you tell us about the two guys
sitting behind Serioga and I?

527
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,080
I believe they're both really

528
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,000
smart and talented guys
from the former Soviet Union,

529
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,400
Belarus and Russia,

530
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,640
who are living proof that
you can come here alone,

531
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,360
with empty pockets,

532
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,520
and create multimillion-dollar companies
with nothing but hard work and your vision.

533
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,720
Alone.

534
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,800
I watched this happen
for both of them.

535
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,080
Both Dima Dumik and Mikita
created huge companies

536
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,080
from scratch
right before my eyes.

537
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
I'd look at them and think:
"What am I doing with my life?"

538
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,040
For the last two days,
Andrey has been preparing me,

539
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,160
saying: "I have your carbon copy
living in my house."

We do look alike!

546
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,360
- You too were born in '86?
- Yes.

547
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,800
- But you're from Taganrog.
- Yes.

548
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,040
Okay. It's a little bit spooky.

549
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,000
But okay, let the audience decide.

550
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,680
Can you explain in super simple
terms what chatbots are?

551
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,040
Chatbots are... You're talking
to someone in the Messenger, right?

552
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,160
- Yeah?
- You can similarly talk to a business.

553
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
You can ask questions,
request help our support,

554
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,920
while a business can communicate
with you, engage you, send you GIFs.

555
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,040
They'll ask:
"Yura, what are you into?"

556
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,520
"You're going to San Francisco. We're
having an event. You should come."

557
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,760
It's super personalized communication.

558
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
- But I need to subscribe?
- Yes.

559
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,680
And it'll tlalk...
(butchers the word, gurgles)

560
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,680
- It'll talk to me on Facebook?
- Yes.

561
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,520
Not on Telegram or..?

562
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,920
There are other platforms that work
with Telegram and other messengers.

563
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,840
- Yours, only on Facebook?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,760
Okay.

565
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,240
Right. How do you monetize it?

566
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,640
Businesses pay a fee to use
the platform to send messages.

567
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,320
The more users you want to reach
the more you pay, on a monthly basis.

568
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,560
- Some of your clients are Uber...
- Yes.

569
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,400
- Coca-Cola...
- Yes.
- And even Golden State.
- Yes.

570
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,840
[The Golden State Warriors are a professional]
[basketball team based in San Francisco]
Assuming I've become your client,
how much do I pay?

571
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,080
$15 to start. Up to 1000 users.

572
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,080
Right. What's the cap?

573
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,240
There is no cap.

574
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,520
But the biggest clients pay
tens of thousands of dollars.

575
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,960
- Tens of thousands?
- Yeah. A month.

576
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,600
Okay. What's your monthly profit?

577
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,440
Uhm...

578
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,080
I can't announce it publicly,

579
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,320
but it's in hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

580
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,200
- That's profit?
- No, that's our revenue.
- Gotcha.

581
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,760
- But you make a profit?
- Yeah.

582
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Yes, we have a positive
operating margin.

583
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
- You haven't sold the company yet?
- No.

584
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,760
- Andrey says that if you do,
you'll be a multimillionaire.
- It's a possibility.

585
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,960

that I just want to hug you!

593
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,880
Why "Mikado"?

594
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,680
- When I was 19, I came to America
for the first time.
- Right?

595
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,440
As part of a student
exchange program.

596
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,200
What was it?
Work and Travel USA.

597
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,400
I came over and was lodged
at this Japanese guy's house.

598
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,360
The Japanese guy used to call me

599
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,760
Mikita, Makaka, Mikaka,

600
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Mikado...

601
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,160
That last one sort of stuck.

602
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,040
- Then they launched LinkedIn.
- Yeah.

603
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Back then, using your real name
on a social network was kinda scary.

604
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,800
I registered as Mikita Mikado

605
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,120
and optimized this LinkedIn account
for certain search engine inquiries.

606
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,600
"Website development Hawaii."
I lived in Hawaii at the time.

607
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,920
People started contacting me.
I started getting business.

608
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,920
I made a business card
for Mikita Mikado.

609
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,080
I started signing contracts,

610
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,880
making and selling websites.

611
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,480
I was just using it more and more.

612
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,360
- 'Cause my last name is impossible

- What is it?

- Oh! Teplouhov?
- Yeah, yeah.

617
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,240
Wow. Complicated.

618
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,720
- I thought only popular singers
used stage names.
- Well, now you know.

619
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,240
- Programmers too.
- Programmers do too, yeah.

620
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,120
Damn!

621
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,520
What does your business do?

622
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,640
- Ever signed a document? A contract?
- Yes.

623
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,560
We make it so you can sign
documents without paper,

624
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,640
without couriers, mailing documents
and so on.

625
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,480
- And they have the same legal power
as documents signed on paper?
- Yes!

626
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,920
- For real?
- It works.

627
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,480
You can test it.

628
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,880
- So we can sign documents remotely?
- Yeah. Uhm...

629
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,440
Important...

630
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
It's worth noting that
it works in the US and...

631
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,120
- ...countries with...
- Electronic document flow?

632
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,200
Not just electronic document flow,
but also e-signature laws.

633
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,560
- Oh. They don't exist in Russia.
- They're a little different.

634
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,000
When I came to Google, they didn't
offer me to work with mobile phones.

635
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,640
It was all only starting
back then.

636
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,440
For a while, I worked
on some other things.

637
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,600
Only about two years later, they put
together a mobile team in London

638
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,240
that made mobile apps
for all of their products.

639
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,920
- What year was that?
- This was 2008.

640
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,320
- 2008?
- Yeah.

641
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,640
They trusted you with something because
you did this mobile thing back in Russia?

642
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,360
They trusted me with something because
no one thought it was important.

643
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,120
They thought it was nonsense.

644
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,760
But how? This is 2008.
Everyone has phones.

645
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,520
Couldn't they see that..?

646
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,280
At that point, people hadn't
yet connected the dots

647
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,640
in their heads that the internet would be
something you carry around in your pocket.

648
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,920
Everyone though the internet was:
you come home, turn on your computer

649
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,280
and go online using
a modem or a wire.

650
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,240
Mobile was for calling and
sending short messages.

651
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:22,200
Maybe occasional email. That was the pinnacle
of communications technology.

652
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,600
The idea that people would
watch movies on their phones

653
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,000
or play online games

654
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,640
sounded like unrealistic futurism.

655
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,800
You said you specifically asked them to let
you develop the mobile app for YouTube?

656
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,440
To be honest, when I joined
their mobile team,

657
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,800
all the good products had already been
assigned to more talented folks.

658
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,600
Stuff like Gmail, the Google search itself,
they were already assigned to someone.

659
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,360
Only leftovers no one
else wanted remained.

660
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,040
YouTube was one
of the things that...

661
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,960
I mean, no one cared about the browser
version either, did they?

662
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,080
All it had were some dogs on
skateboards and similar garbage.

663
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,720
I was the new guy.

664
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,800
They offered me a choice of several
not very successful products.

665
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,520
When they offered YouTube...

666
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,840
I knew that Tapok that I made back
in Russia was almost the same thing.

667
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,760
I knew that people would watch
video on their phones

668
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,760
because they used to BUY them
on my site.

669
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,680
People from backwater towns used to
buy Crazy Frog videos through SMS

670
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
to simply go: "Hey, man!
Check it out! Crazy Frog!"

671
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,920
This was my first project,

672
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,120
a mobile app that let you
use your phone to...

673
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,320
You're speaking.
There's a presentation.

674
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,920
It let you change slides, record
your voice and broadcast it.

675
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,440
- This didn't exist prior?
- Nope.

676
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,720
- Right. It didn't take off?
- Crashed and burned.

677
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,040
Right. Then?

678
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,600
Then I... We'd raised money for it,
venture money.

679
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,360
- Which you didn't return?
- No, of course not.

680
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah. The project didn't take off.
I realized no one's ever giving us money again.

681
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,520
I met my partner,

682
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,360
the now CTO of my current company.

683
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,800
We figured we had
one last chance.

684
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,880
We either do something or I'm just
not cut out for startups

685
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,480
and I should go back
to corporations.

686
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,840
[Before creating startups, Dumik spent]
[5 years at Procter & Gamble]
I had to call my parents.

687
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,960
[Before creating startups, Dumik spent]
[5 years at Procter & Gamble]
I'd been supporting
myself for a while,

688
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'd been supporting
myself for a while,

689
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,080
but at 25, I had to call them to borrow
several thousand dollars.

690
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,680
You know, "this is my last chance."

691
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,960
And it took off.

692
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,800
It was a mobile app, Myata.

693
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,760
And... We knew there was
no room for failure.

694
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,360
We were two people. We did everything
ourselves: coding, design, product.

695
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,040
Myata was the thing that assembled
a feed based on your interests?

696
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,920
- Yes. It's an app...
- For VK.
- Yes. Yeah.

697
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,680
Okay. What do you mean by "took off?"
It made you money?

698
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,560
Yes. It made us money.
"Took off" means that

699
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,000
when we launched on App Store,
we reached #2 on App Store.

700
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
We had 300,000 downloads
in a week.

701
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,560
And we started monetizing it
with ads.

702
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,400
How much did it make you?

703
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,720
We sold it. We sold
the Russian version.

704
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,320
We had a Russian version.
We decided to make a global one.

705
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,720
We sold the Russian version. For not too
much, several hundred thousand dollars.

706
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,480
We started working on the global
version, and it was a struggle.

707
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,120
They use Facebook. It has its own
rules and restrictions.

708
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,119
That's when Pasha Durov
posted in his blog,

709
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,919
saying: "Guys, we're launching
chatbots on the Telegram platform."

710
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,399
I call Tioma and go: "Hey, wake up."
He's in Moscow, it's night. I'm here.

711
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,480
"Tioma, wake up. This is the next big thing.
We need to make something."

712
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,480
A team of developers needs to make it
so there's a YouTube icon on the screen.

713
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,600
How many years?
What are the steps?

714
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,799
Well, there are YouTube servers
somewhere out there

715
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,600
hosting videos and sending them
via the internet to some device.

716
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,239
The device must be powerful
enough to decode them.

717
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,320
The connection must be fast
enough to download them.

718
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,520
And then this app needs to work on this
small device with its small processor

719
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,600
to download videos, to offer you choice
of videos and different menus.

720
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,160
They key piece of course is the player that
decodes and plays videos in real time.

721
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,000
At the time, this was a fairly
complicated task,

722
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,280
because we were developing it
from scratch for those old phones.

723
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,760
The first app was actually designed for
Nokias and old Windows PDAs.

724
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,080
It didn't work. It was awful.

725
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,760
During the first year, I thought:
"What am I doing here?"

726
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
"It probably won't work."

727
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,760
When did you realize
that it will?

728
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,920
When Android came out.

729
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,920
The player worked on the first
Android that we launched.

730
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,840
[The first version of Android]
[came out in September of 2008]
The player worked on the first
Android that we launched.

731
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,280
[The first version of Android]
[came out in September of 2008]
This was yet another prophetic but
seemingly idiotic move,

732
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
This was yet another prophetic but
seemingly idiotic move,

733
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,760
because there were zero Androids
and millions of Nokias.

734
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,640
But nothing worked on Nokia, while on Android
we could get it to work.

735
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,440
I only had, like, two or three
engineers at that moment.

736
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,360
We decided to go for it

737
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,320
and switched over to Android.

738
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,360
And later iPhone.
And it worked.

739
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,120
When we got our first 100,000
views on mobile phones,

740
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,240
obviously, the site youtube.com
had millions of views by that point,

741
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,600
but mobile users had cumulatively added
100,000 to that number, and we went to a bar,

742
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,760
I bought all the engineers beer.

743
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,600
We were joking around:

744
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,640
hey, 100,000 views is free beer, cool,
but what do we get for one million?

745
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,280
I said: "Guys, one day, mobile YouTube
will be bigger than that other YouTube."

746
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,160
"When this happens..."

747
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,600
My engineering partner says: "When this
happens, you'll take us to Hawaii."

748
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,880
I said:
"Yeah, I'll take you to Hawaii."

749
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,200
I did.

750
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,280
When did this happen?

751
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,280
This was somewhere
around 2013 or 2014.

752
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,640
Today, most people watch
YouTube on their phones?

753
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,240
I can guarantee you that most people
watching this video of us

754
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
are most likely watching it
in the app I helped launch.

755
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,480
(title card music)

756
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,400

(muffled voices)

758

(wind, passing cars)

759
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,200
(Davidov) Gamedev is a huge industry.
Just like filmmaking.

760
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,880
Gamedev is bigger than filmmaking.

We have people from all over, because you can no longer say that CoD was made in the US.

770

Russians, Ukrainians, Americans, Brits.

772

Same with other projects.

They're now global corporations.

774
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,320
Just like us. We have
people from all over.

775
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,160
For example, someone's
making a video game,

776
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,760
they hire you to create some of the art
and pay you to do it.

777
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,440
We help large companies
produce content on time,

778
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,120
because games are becoming more
and more complex and expansive.

779
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
You can't produce everything in-house.

780
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,800
That's why they delegate art and coding
to talents from around the world.

781
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,240
We help them with that.

782
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,040
What if we decide that our show
needs some graphics?

783
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,200
Say, for our geographic routes.

784
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,480
We want a super map
that shows us

785
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,800
going from Moscow to San Fran,

786
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,520
to the Valley, to the towns.

787
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
How much will it cost us?

788
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,680
Depends on task description.

789
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
If you know exactly what you want,
it's figure A.

790
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,040
If you go, "Maks, let's change this part," it's B.
If you wanna redo the whole thing, it's C.

791
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,560
Let's say, we know exactly.

792
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,320
This costs anywhere from
$10,000 to $100,000.

793
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
But it depends on

794
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,240
whether we can show it,

795
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,720
whether you let us display it,

796
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,840
and if you're a pleasant
person to work with.

797
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,000
Besides, we want a client
like Yura on our portfolio,

798
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,840
so we could do it
for a cup of coffee.

How did you end up all the way
out here, in the Silicon Valley?

801
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,560
I started working in ninth grade.

802
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,800
First with Russians, then quickly
switched to Americans.

since ninth grade.
- Doing what?

804
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,560

I made websites, logos, applications.

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,560
Then I switched to digital art.

806
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,440
I created art for many games:

807
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,920
Call of Duty, Fallout, World of Tanks.

808
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,120
I started out as an artist,

809
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,440
then senior artist,
then I supervised some people,

810
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,160
then I started my own company.

811
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,680
For World of Tanks,
we made a ton of tanks,

812
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,920
environmental objects,
barrels, airplanes.

813
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,560
Lots of stuff.

814
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,280
Then you see it in the game. And millions
of people are buying this tank with real money.

815
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,880
The feeling's orgasmic.

816
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
You're thinking: "Fuck!"

817
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,080
What did it look like?

818
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,200
You're in Ulyanovsk,
in your apartment...

819
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
[*Low-cost standardized apartment building]
[mass-built from mid-'60s to '80s.]
- Hrushovka*?
- Yeah.

820
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,160
In Ulyanovsk. How did you draw?

821
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,720
Did you have a special tablet?

822
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,160
Yeah, I got a tablet. I didn't initially.
I just had a mouse.

823
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,320
I'd draw with it, super poorly.

824
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,280
I'd look at other people's works and
wondered what's wrong with my hand:

825
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,800
why are my works so... crooked.

826
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,280
- Then I realized I needed to get a tablet
that cost my entire salary.
- Yeah?

827
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,160
I saved up, my parents pitched in too,
and I bought myself a tablet.

828
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,360
And away we went! Turned out, drawing
on your computer was super convenient!

829
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,200
Wait, do you have any artistic talents
or was it formulaic stuff?

830
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,560
I studied at Kuliok.

831
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,360
That's our University of Arts
in Ulyanovsk.

832
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,560
I was a very bad student,
actually.

833
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,120
And I'm ashamed, because instead
of painting art and understanding Ayvazovskiy,

834
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,880
I'd draw all these zombies, and monsters,
and women with big boobs,

835
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,560
because I drew inspiration
from games.

836
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,480
Teachers would give me C's.
I'd go home, draw my stuff,

837
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,720
and the Americans would go:
"Dude, great! We love you!"

838
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,400
I was like: "So am I an A or a C student?
What am I, really?"

839
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
My big advantage was
that I didn't argue.

840
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,840
I think we still have
this issue in Russia

841
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,760
where we believe that getting
feedback is always shitty.

842
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,280
I go: "Yura, you need different jeans."
You go: "Piss off, Maks."

843
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,320
Something like that.
Many act this way at home.

844
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,320
I'd go: "Great feedback.
Thank you."

845
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,160
I knew I was inexperienced
and they knew better.

846
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,520
I didn't argue.
I just said: "Let's do it this way. Or that way."
Or: "Here's a couple of options."

847
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,920
'Cause Americans are often
super busy

848
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,360
and they just go: "Hey, can you make us
a tank for Call of Duty?"

849
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,280
You say: "Okay. Any references,
pictures and stuff?"

850
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,840
They go: "We leave it to you."

851
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,160
Basically, our subsequent work
needs to make them go:

852
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,000
"Option A. With this track.
Tomorrow. Go."

853
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,080
We need to meet them
halfway sometimes.

854
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,400
Others often go: "I need a detailed task
description. I can't work without one."

855
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,040
"Give me a detailed
task description."

856
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,040
Clients often don't have
time for that.

857
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,840
Your point is, being proactive
and self-reliant rules?

858
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,160
Being proactive, self-reliant, able to predict
what the client wants,

859
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,560
and giving options are the things
that I find help a lot.

860
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,720
When you're not sure what they want,
make two options. Or better yet, three.

861
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,680
And say:
"Here's what you asked. Here's my vision.
And here's a crazy third option."

862
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,800
The client will appreciate it.

863
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,600
- (Dud') This is the entire valley?
- (Davidov) Yes. This is the entire Silicon Valley.

864
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,840
You can see its every
corner from here.

865
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,520
(Dud') Palo Alto, Mountain View.

866
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,160
That was is San Jose.
San Jose is where the Valley started.

867
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,440
The semiconductor companies
started out there.

868
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,360
[Fairchild Semiconductor designed integrated circuits and]
[was one of the Valley's biggest companies in the 1960s]
Fairchild Semiconductor. Those guys
would get military grants.

869
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,800
[Fairchild Semiconductor designed integrated circuits and]
[was one of the Valley's biggest companies in the 1960s]
They made the first computers,
exclusively for the military and NASA.

870
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,880
[Semiconductor companies produce electronic]
[devices like circuit boards, transistors, LEDs]
That's where life sort of started.

871
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,720
[Semiconductor companies produce electronic]
[devices like circuit boards, transistors, LEDs]
Stanford graduates finally had
a place to go to make big bucks.

872
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,920
It all started in the '50s,
with Stanford

873
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,200
and

874
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,680
the super liberal vision of
then head of the university

875
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,600
who began to sponsor his
graduates, lending them

876
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,760
[Wallace Sterling was the President of Stanford University]
[from 1949 to 1968. The Research Park was spearheaded]
[by Frederick Terman (it was his influence that led Stanford]
[graduates to create Hewlett-Packard in the 1930s)].
[In the 1950s, the university leased some of its land to]
[high-tech companies and expanded its operations to get]
[government grants from the Department of Defense.]
[Terman is considered the father of the Silicon Valley]
who began to sponsor his
graduates, lending them

877
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,520
[Wallace Sterling was the President of Stanford University]
[from 1949 to 1968. The Research Park was spearheaded]
[by Frederick Terman (it was his influence that led Stanford]

[In the 1950s, the university leased some of its land to]

[Terman is considered the father of the Silicon Valley]
offices or space
to use as offices,

878
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,840
[Wallace Sterling was the President of Stanford University]
[from 1949 to 1968. The Research Park was spearheaded]
[by Frederick Terman (it was his influence that led Stanford]

[In the 1950s, the university leased some of its land to]
[high-tech companies and expanded its operations to get]
[government grants from the Department of Defense.]
[Terman is considered the father of the Silicon Valley]
and was essentially the pioneer
of this whole venture capitalism idea.

879
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
That's how Hewlett-Packard
was founded.

880
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,400
[Venture capital is risky investments]
[in brand new types of business]
The very idea of nurturing talent

881
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,080
[Venture capital is risky investments]
[in brand new types of business]
and believing in it so much that you give
them money so they try to create something

882
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,960
and believing in it so much that you give
them money so they try to create something

883
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,480
in this brand new, totally foreign
at the time field of

884
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,960
semiconductors, processors and so on

885
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,160
started out in Stanford.

886
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,480
Then the inventor of
the transistor came here.

887
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,640
He created a company,

888
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,600
it was fairly despotic, I mean,
he was a fairly despotic genius,

889
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,960
[Company in question is Fairchild Semiconductor]
[with its founder William Shockley]
it was fairly despotic, I mean,
he was a fairly despotic genius,

890
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,200
[Company in question is Fairchild Semiconductor]
[with its founder William Shockley]
and he ended up losing
eight of his key engineers.

891
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,600
and he ended up losing
eight of his key engineers.

892
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,360
These eight key engineers who earned
the nickname "the traitorous eight"

893
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,160
actually created the second super
important element of the Valley,

894
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,920
the flow of ideas,

895
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,000
the tolerance for the idea that people may
leave your company to start their own,

896
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,440
and it's okay.

897
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,040
They all left and founded
all the key companies.

898
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Intel, AMD and others

899
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,840
were in one way or another
fathered by those eight dudes.

900
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,240
Stanford is basically the cradle
of the Silicon Valley.

901
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,680
Its students went on to become founders of Google,
senior execs at Facebook, Microsoft, EA, LinkedIn.

902
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,960
They all studied at or at least
got accepted to Stanford.

903
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,760
- (Dud') But didn't all graduate?
- (Miheyenko) MANY of them didn't.

904
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,360
Let me try and outline the history
of founding of Stanford very quickly.

905
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,040
[ILYA STREBULAYEV]
[44 years old]
[Professor of Finance at the Stanford University]
[Graduate School of Business]
There was a rich man who made
a lot of money on railroads.

906
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,960
[ILYA STREBULAYEV]
[44 years old]
[Professor of Finance at the Stanford University]
[Graduate School of Business]
His son died at 15
from typhoid fever.

907
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,040
And he decided to found
a university in his memory.

908
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Is it true, that 150 years ago,

909
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,760
founding a university
in someone's memory

910
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,000
was a brow-raising decision?

911
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,480
It was, but not because it was
founded in someone's memory.

912
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,400
It raised brows because California
was a backwater state at the time.

913
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,440
The idea of creating something
bright in California

914
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,360
was hard to process.

915
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,240
Moreover, there already was
a university in California.

916
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,800
There was a university at the other
end of the San Francisco Bay,

917
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,640
one of the most respected
universities in America today,

918
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,040
University of California,
Berkeley

919
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,800
And this was a state university.

920
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,920
I think many laughed at Stanford

921
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,600
for trying to create something that
could compete with Berkeley.

922
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,560
And what's the point of a second
university in California?

923
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,000
A lot has changed
in the last 150 years!

924
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,920
A lot HAS changed.
And not in the last 150 years,

925
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,840
but probably much closer to now.

926
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,560
'Cause even around the time
World War II broke out,

927
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,280
I doubt the major East Coast
universities

928
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,040
like Harvard, Princeton and Yale
saw a competitor in Stanford.

929
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,040
Then it all suddenly changed
in the span of 15 or 20 years.

930
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,720
The greatest garage in the Valley

931
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,800
is not Jobs' and Wozniak's garage,
but the Hewlett-Packard garage?

932
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,960
Yes. It was where it all started,
this whole culture.

933
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,200
Hewlett-Packard was the first operation
that Stanford sponsored.

934
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,120
That garage was where the seeds
of this culture were created.

935
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,400
A lot of other companies were later
started in garages, including Google.

936
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,640
Google started in
Susan Wojcicki's garage.

937
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,200
Today she's the CEO of YouTube.

938
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,560
(blows a kiss)
Our queen!

939
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,680
- What's that behind you?
- That's the campus of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business.

940
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,120
You mentioned a garage for startups?

941
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,680
Yeah. Startup Garage.

942
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,400
- What do they do there?
- Or the Stanford Venture Studio.

943
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,840
It's very interesting.
About 5 or 6 years ago,

944
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,600
we decided to open what we called
the Startup Garage,

945
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,880
where over the course of
one semester or one quarter,

946
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,720
Stanford uses the Quarter System
with the summer quarter off,

947
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,280
over the course one quarter, our students
at the Graduate Business School

948
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,800
could practice actual entrepreneurship.

949
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,840
Over the course of a quarter,
they could gather into small groups,

950
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
organize their own startups,

951
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,360
discuss different ideas,

952
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,320
get assistance from our alumni,

953
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,040
[Angel investors support]
[startups in their earliest stages]
angel investors, venture capitalists,
professors and so on.

954
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,440
[Angel investors support]
[startups in their earliest stages]
We didn't initially intend for these
startups to become real startups.

955
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,840
We didn't initially intend for these
startups to become real startups.

956
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:31,400
The idea was to let first- and second-year
students to try their hand

957
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,400
and get a feel,

958
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,560
and obtain certain skills required
for becoming entrepreneurs.

959
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,440
Initially, we believed this was
a purely educational process.

960
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,280
Just another program.

961
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,120
We have a lot of wonderful,
informative programs.

962
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,400
But in these 5 or 6 years,
everything changed.

963
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,920
Turned out, at this stage, students
can band together for just one quarter,

964
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,680
students from the business,
engineering and medical schools,

965
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,200
come up with an interesting idea
and tinker with it a little

966
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,360
without getting any sort of money,
any financing,

967
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,880
or assistance from
the Stanford University,

968
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,520
for just one quarter,

969
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,520
and in an insignificant number of cases
this leads to a real startup.

970
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,320
There are now real firms that
came out of this Startup Garage.

971
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,440
And they actually make money?

972
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,720
They've raised some serious money
from serious venture capitalists,

973
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,520
and some of them now
cost billions of dollars.

974
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,120
(man) Oh wow!

975
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
- (Dud') Hey! Hi.
- Hi. Tolik.

976
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,640
- Tolik, what are you doing here?
- Me? I...

977
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,480
- (Dud') Is that a check from your investor?
You all set?
- Yeah!

978
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
(Dud') Oh yeah? Nice!

979
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,840
- No, what is that?
- It's actually a check to pay for my wife's
medical insurance.

980
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,520
- Really?
- Yeah. Costs an arm and a leg.
I got my PhD at Stanford.

981
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,880
Where are you from?

982
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,400
- I'm from Krasnodar.
- Right?

983
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,920
I spent a lot of time in Moscow,
moved to Norway,

984
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
went back to Moscow,
bailed and came here.

985
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,800
(Miheyenko) You're in IT too?

986
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,600
I'm a co-founder. Typical stuff
for these parts.

987
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,720
But what I actually do is...

988
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,400
I spent a lot of time doing
geological surveying.

989
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,400
Uh-huh?

990
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,560
I'm developing this combination
artificial intelligence for geology.

991
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,880
Why do you need AI in geology for?

992
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,880
For example, there's computer vision
currently used in autonomous cars

993
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,920
that lets them identify trees,
pedestrians, what have you.

994
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,520
But what's happening underground,
we don't know. At all.

995
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,440
We don't have a good scanner.

996
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:35,360
Let's say, I have information
that we can get from sources...

997
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,000
Without sending anything down?

998
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,280
No, no. For example, there's some
acoustic information from a scanner,

999
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,240
but it doesn't give us true information.

1000
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,640
Like, it's not a universal truth,
it's not real information.

1001
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,000
Some devices can use systems

1002
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,680
like AI and computer vision

1003
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,440
to interpret what's really
going on underground.

1004
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,320
The dude we met at Stanford.
Do you know him?

1005
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,160
Yeah. That's my brother's friend

1006
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,840
who got inspired by his example and moved
here too. They live next to each other.

1007
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,680
And he's launching a startup...
grounded in geology?

1008
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,360
I hope he's make it, yeah.

1009
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,080
That's what I love the most:

1010
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,720
people with different backgrounds,

1011
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,520
from all over the world

1012
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,680
get inspired by this spirit
of entrepreneurship.

1013
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,480
It's very easy to get stuck in
an environment where you think:

1014
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,320
"Me, an entrepreneur? Nah.
You have to be someone's son."

1015
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,200
"Or you have to be insane."

1016
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,280
That's what I thought
back in Medvedkovo.

1017
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,680
"No, this is crazy. Entrepreneurship?"

1018
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,760
They move here, and it comes
so naturally here,

1019
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,680
that every Uber driver is also
doing business on the side.

1020
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,040
Every cashier in the supermarket.

1021
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,640
How does entrepreneurship
benefit society?

1022
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,640
I mean, why is it better than
working for the state?

1023
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,800
Entrepreneurship improves
the stability of the society.

1024
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,240
In my view, you want the economy
to look like a grape cluster:

1025
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,960
lots of small sweet berries

1026
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
that together form this big fruit.

1027
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,600
When you have an economy
that's like a single watermelon,

1028
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,360
if you drop it, the entire
watermelon's ruined.

1029
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,080
Whereas when you're economy
is like a grape cluster,

1030
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,080
you've got natural selection,
competition,

1031
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,520
a ton of ideas being tested
at the same time.

1032
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,280
You have this fluidity and adaptivity

1033
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,600
that let society react quickly
to rapidly changing circumstances.

1034
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,920
Without the internet,
economy was one way.

1035
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,800
The internet came along, and a ton of
global businesses collapsed,

1036
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,920
you know, these enormous beasts.

1037
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,680
But then a ton of...

1038
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,240
In a society where
entrepreneurship was normal,

1039
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,600
a ton of new companies immediately
emerged in their place,

1040
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,760
the future facebooks and googles

1041
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,280
and other multi-billion
corporations,

1042
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,960
in a world where...

1043
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,440
I mean, in '92, none of them were close
to emerging or even possible.

1044
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,320
(Dud') Dasha Navalnaya is studying
here since this year.

1045
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,560
(Miheyenko) I read on the news.
Sadly, haven't seen her around.

1046
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,920
There are a lot of Russian
students here, Chinese, Indian.

1047
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,800
They get education here.

1048
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,680
They become a part of the society
and they know it.

1049
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,000
We have a lot of clients here,
and they show what Stanford is.

1050
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,800
It's the spirit of entrepreneurship.

1051
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,760
[*Moscow State University.]
It's not even about knowledge.
MSU* isn't any worse.

1052
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,640
They teach you here that you can open
your own startup tomorrow,

1053
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,040
come up to your dean
or your professor,

1054
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,680
and they'll give you $5 million
in the initial investment round.

1055
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,400
We have a friend named Tony.
He graduated from here.

1056
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,160
He created a startup that
teaches children coding.

1057
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,080
His math professor was his
first investor.

1058
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,240
- Did the startup take off?
- Yes.

1059
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,560
And the professor made millions?

1060
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,040
He hasn't reached IPO yet.

1061
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,760
He hasn't made any money yet,
but his shares did skyrocket.

1062
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,000
[IPO (initial public offering) is initial sale of company]
[shares on the market to invite investors]
[or make money from the sale]
He hasn't made any money yet,
but his shares did skyrocket.

1063
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,480
[IPO (initial public offering) is initial sale of company]
[shares on the market to invite investors]
[or make money from the sale]
'Cause they went into the second
investment round,

1064
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,240
[IPO (initial public offering) is initial sale of company]
[shares on the market to invite investors]
[or make money from the sale]
and this Stanford professor...

1065
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,520
They invest bits of their salary?

1066
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,200
- Like, their savings?
- Their savings and the money they made
from other startups.

1067
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,040
I wish I could come to my dean
in Ulyanovsk and go:

1068
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:16,680
"Sir, could you spare a couple mil?
I have this dream project in the works..."

1069
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,440
Sadly, that won't work
over there just yet.

1070
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,960
If you're a professor
at Stanford University

1071
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,400
or a student, or an employee
of the University,

1072
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,920
and you get an idea,

1073
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,480
the university offers you the opportunity
to develop this idea,

1074
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,240
to take it out of the University walls

1075
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
and commercialize this idea.

1076
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,000
The University provides
ample assistance,

1077
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,840
both formal and informal.

1078
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,200
For example, with the help of numerous
alumni of the University

1079
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,240
that help you develop this idea,

1080
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,360
with advice and financially.

1081
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,480
But most importantly,
the University has a culture

1082
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,240
and a vision that these
initiatives are welcomed.

1083
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:07,440
As a result, a lot of, for example, professors
of Stanford University have their own startups.

1084
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,440
You mean they're investors?

1085
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,280
No, no. They're founders of startups.

1086
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,480
- Ohh!
- They create startups themselves.

1087
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,480
I'll give you an example.

1088
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,520
There was a professor at the Stanford
University that specialized in biochemistry.

1089
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,480
He came with an idea in his lab
to create the so-called artificial meat.

1090
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,440
Had he been a professor
at some other place,

1091
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,360
this idea would've probably died
in terms of commercial application.

1092
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,000
But by using his contacts,

1093
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,800
by using the Stanford University,

1094
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,920
he became the founder or
a co-founder of a startup,

1095
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,840
raised substantial venture money,

1096
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,400
and now his Impossible Foods is one of
the most successful companies out there.

1097
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,400
[Impossible Foods was founded in 2011.]
[It has raised $1.2 billion as of March of 2020.]
[It produces plant-based meat products,]
[including burgers]
Is his still a professor?

1098
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,120
[Impossible Foods was founded in 2011.]
[It has raised $1.2 billion as of March of 2020.]
[It produces plant-based meat products,]
[including burgers]
He continued to work as a professor
for many years.

1099
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,440
[Impossible Foods was founded in 2011.]
[It has raised $1.2 billion as of March of 2020.]
[It produces plant-based meat products,]
[including burgers]
I believe he left the position
some time ago

1100
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,720
and focused on his startup that's now
become a multibillion-dollar company.

1101
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,280
But there are other examples where people
continue working as professors.

1102
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,800
For example, my another colleague,
Daphne Koller,

1103
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,600
a Computer Science professor,

1104
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,600
who founded Coursera,
a very famous educational startup.

1105
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,600
She works as a professor
at Stanford University.

1106
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,240
I don't have any school expenses,
only living expenses,

1107
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,440
'cause it's freaking
expensive here.

1108
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,520
How come you're getting
free tuition?

1109
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,000
Special talent?

1110
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,320
No. Stanford just sponsors a lot of people
that come here and study for free.

1111
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,600
They offer free tuition,
housing allowance...

1112
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,960
In exchange for what?
What do you give them?

1113
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
In exchange for me doing
my research here.

1114
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,080
I also hold a research assistant
position here.

1115
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,120
I mean, they do it in exchange
for Stanford...

1116
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,280
- Stanford call themselves The Farm.
- Yeah?

1117
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,600
Their idea is:

1118
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,560
"You guys come here,
you're like saplings."

1119
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,080
"We plant you, water you,
and share certain values with you."

1120
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,840
Different values.

1121
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,680
Cultural, social.

1122
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,080
"Then spread out wherever you go

1123
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,760
"and spread these values to other
people one way or another."

1124
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,320
It's a sort of missionary work,
you could call it.

1125
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,640
- Or soft power.
- Exactly, yes.

1126
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,960
It's soft power.

1127
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,760
Why does the Stanford University
support entrepreneurship?

1128
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,760
Does the Stanford University
take a cut off its beneficiaries?

1129
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,440
That's a great question.

1130
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,960
Two questions, actually:
why and does it?

1131
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,680
Taking a cut depends on how much of the resources
of the Stanford University were used.

1132
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,120
I'll give you two examples.

1133
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,440
In the '90s, two startups were created,
Google and Yahoo!

1134
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,240
They were both created by students
of the Stanford University.

1135
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,960
Google's founders used the University's
resources quite extensively.

1136
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,560
Stanford came to the conclusion that

1137
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:57,080
because this search engine was
an in-house Stanford project,

1138
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,720
this technology belonged
to the Stanford University.

1139
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,120
So Google bought the rights to
the technology from Stanford.

1140
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,160
Yes, at some point in the past, Stanford owned
a considerable amount of Google's shares.

1141
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,800
[Google was initially even hosted on]
[the university's domain, google.stanford.edu]
Yes, at some point in the past, Stanford owned
a considerable amount of Google's shares.

1142
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,000
[Google was initially even hosted on]
[the university's domain, google.stanford.edu]
With Yahoo!, this was another Stanford
student, Jerry Yang,

1143
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,400
[Google was initially even hosted on]
[the university's domain, google.stanford.edu]
but the kinds of University resources he'd used
were night hours and such,

1144
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,800
and so, as far as I know,

1145
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,280
Stanford University concluded that
university resources hadn't been used,

1146
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:28,520
and so it wasn't involved
with Yahoo! shares.

1147
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,080
But then what's the point
for the University?

1148
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,160
The point for the university...
There's a number of reasons.

1149
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,320
First, because it's a very
natural balance,

1150
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,920
because lots of scientists care about
the application of their knowledge.

1151
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,280
It's very important.

1152
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,040
Because many European universities

1153
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,200
treat entrepreneurship
very differently.

1154
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,200
Over there, a professor sits
on a high mountain,

1155
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,880
thinking and inventing
something great,

1156
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,200
while someone else scuttles around at the foot
of the mountain , trying to put it to work.

1157
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,760
Down here, it's very different
That's number one.

1158
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:12,080
Two, we earlier discussed the interaction between
the scientific and the learning processes.

1159
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:17,880
It's very important, because in all these
examples I brought up students often take part

1160
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,560
in practical application of new
scientific knowledge.

1161
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,200
Obviously, most of our students
don't become professors.

1162
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,320
- Most of them head out into the so-called
real world.
- Yeah.

1163
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,680
Thanks to first-hand experience of
applying the knowledge they get here

1164
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,200
in interesting practical projects,

1165
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,800
they can work in the real world with
a lot more responsibility and success.

1166
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,920
And the monetary appeal is,
if you do become a millionaire,

1167
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,680
you'll donate to them
as their graduate?

1168
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,280
Absolutely.

1169
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,680
Besides, lots of Stanford graduates are
VPs of a bunch of major companies.

1170
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,200
They donate a ton of money on
research groups and their support.

1171
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,320
- Including you?
- Yep. Precisely.
- Damn.

1172
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,200
You know how much money they get
each year in donations?

1173
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,000
- Who?
- You know the figure? Stanford.

1174
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,480
- From their graduates.
- No.

1175
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,480
- One billion bucks.
- Holy crap!

1176
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,400
I tried to imagine this money.
It's freaking crazy!

1177
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,320
One thing I found interesting about
the 18-year-olds that enroll here.

1178
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,960
We choose a faculty once
and stick with it.

1179
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,880
You pick the Journalism or the Economics Faculty
of the MSU and you study there for 5 years.

1180
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,320
It's different here.

1181
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,600
Precisely. And it's one of
the biggest differences

1182
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,200
between Russian and American
education.

1183
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,440
I enrolled in the Economics Faculty
of the MSU in the '90s.

1184
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,760
I was 18.

1185
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,640
I'm not sure that when you're 18,
you can tell with certainty

1186
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,600
what you want to do
for the rest of your life,

1187
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,680
biology, math, economy
and so on.

1188
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,240
They have a different
approach here.

1189
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,320
You're not enrolling
in a particular faculty.

1190
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,560
They don't have faculties here.

1191
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,960
You enroll in the Stanford University.

1192
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,160
You do what you want
for the first two years.

1193
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,880
Of course, there are limitations:
you have to take at least X courses,

1194
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
you have to do Y amount of work.

1195
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,400
You might get interested
in something along the way.

1196
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:26,560
A ton of people start off on philosophy,
then switch to computer science,

1197
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,000
or start off on physics,
then switch to biology, and so on.

1198
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,480
Usually, only by your third year,

1199
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,200
you're required to choose
a specialization.

1200
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,760
But again, they call this
specialization "a major."

1201
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,280
Major, greater.

1202
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,360
It doesn't mean that
it's all you study.

1203
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,240
It means that a set number
of your subjects

1204
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,880
as well as your bachelor's thesis
will be on this subject.

1205
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,960
There's a sister concept here in America
called "a minor," smaller.

1206
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,760
Many students have
a major and a minor.

1207
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,960
It means that you have
a primary specialization

1208
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,440
and may have a secondary
specialization.

1209
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,360
These two specializations
may be completely unrelated.

1210
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,040
For example, you can have
Computer Science and Economics.

1211
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,960
You can have
Physics and Music.

1212
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,520
- You can have Engineering...
- ...and Marketing?

1213
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,520
You can't get a bachelor's in Marketing,
there are limitations for specializations.

1214
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,800
But, let's say, Engineering and Biology.

1215
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,720
(title card music)

1216
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,120
[*In Russian, "silikon" is both a transliteration]
[of the English name of the element Si (silicon)]
[and the correct name of the compound "silicone."]
[The proper name of the element in Russian is "kremniy."]
[A popular layman translation of the region's name]
[is therefore "Silicone Valley," if translated back to English.]
[The correct name "Kremniy Valley" has become]
[more popular in the recent years.]
Silikon or Kremniy* Valley?

1217
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,680
I vote silikon. I'm actually against
silicone, but for it in this context.

1218
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,240
But... Why? Kremniy is
the correct word, isn't it?

1219
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm used to it! I mean...
It sounds like Silicon Valley!

1220
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,200
It doesn't matter. The Valley isn't
about tits OR silicon.

1221
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,240
It's just a word.

1222
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,880
I thought it was called
Silikon Valley as a kid.

1223
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,280
I dreamed to go to Silikon,
ended up in Kremniy.

1224
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,520
Why Kremniy?

1225
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,520
The English word "silicon"
means "kremniy."

1226
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,440
But somehow, someway,
half the Russians say "Silikon."

1227
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,320
When you hear "Silikon,"
you know that it's wrong?

1228
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,040
My inner Russian language A student says:
"Guys, it's fucking 'Kremniy!'"

1229
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,520
But then my inner Marketing D student says:
"'Silikon' sounds way fucking cooler!"

1230
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,560
(Dud' laughs)

1231
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,720
"My inner A student."

1232
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,320
Nice. Mine too gets me
into trouble all the time.

1233
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,240
- The correct translation is "kremniy."
- Uh-huh?

1234
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,040
"Silikon" is...

1235
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,400
- Acceptable?
- Acceptable.
- Or is it hillbilly talk?

1236
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,280
Hillbilly talk, yeah.

1237
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,920
"Kremniy" of course.
Like the element.

1238
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,920
So anyone who calls it "Silikon"
is a hillbilly?

1239
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,160
Because it's not "silicon."
It's "kremniy."

1240
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,360
What is "silikon?"

1241
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
What's "silikon" in English?

1242
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,760
It's just silicone.

1243
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,600
The word "silikon" is a transliteration
of the English "silicon," i.e. "kremniy."

1244
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,640
(title card music)

1245
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,640
That's the main building
over there, right?

1246
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,640
That one's the main building.
But yeah, this is all the main campus.

1247
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,040
So this where it all... This was the first
building of Sergey Brin and friends?

1248
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,360
Yeah. They originally had
an office in this building,

1249
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,360
where all the big
discussions happened.

1250
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,120
Where do you think is the office
where they bought YouTube?

1251
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,640
I'm sure it was in Marrakesh,
in that building.

1252
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,680
There's a huge conference room there
where they used to make all the decisions.

1253
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,720
I recently remembered that...

1254
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,440
I remember it like it happened yesterday.
I was working for the PROsport magazine.

1255
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,160
One of my colleagues came in the room
and said: "They bought YouTube!"
(Doronichev laughs)

1256
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,120
It's a historical deal!

1257
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,680
They bought the company
for over a billion!

1258
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,240
[In Fall of 2006, Google bought]
[YouTube for $1.65 billion]
They bought the company
for over a billion!

1259
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,240
[In Fall of 2006, Google bought]
[YouTube for $1.65 billion]
Given that today, a billion is nothing for companies
like these, it sounds funny, doesn't it?

1260
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,160
Given that today, a billion is nothing for companies
like these, it sounds funny, doesn't it?

1261
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,320
[In 2018, Morgan Stanley gave an estimate]
[that if YouTube was a separate company,]
[it would've been worth...]
We'll have a caption on screen with YouTube's
current estimated worth.

1262
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,600
[In 2018, Morgan Stanley gave an estimate]
[that if YouTube was a separate company,]
[it would've been worth $160 billion]
I just can't recall from memory.

1263
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,600
[In 2018, Morgan Stanley gave an estimate]
[that if YouTube was a separate company,]
[it would've been worth $160 billion]
It's billions and billions.

1264
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,880
I've been in the Valley
for 5 years now.

1265
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,000
Prior to that, I'd been communicating with
Americans via Skype and email for over 10 years.

1266
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,360
So I initially understood
them through text.

1267
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,760
I was an expert at typing
in English.

1268
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,760
When I first came to the Valley,
I couldn't understand a word

1269
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,440
besides "hello"
and "give me money."

1270
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,560
Then you begin to understand that your
school and your university English

1271
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,120
and California English
are completely different things.

1272
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,120
Texas English is another
thing still.

1273
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,760
When people tell you out here,
"Great! We love it! Fantastic!"

1274
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,280
you can't Google-translate what they
actually mean — you have to sense it.

1275
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,080
Read between the lines.

1276
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,880
When I first came here,
I'd show my portfolio to everyone.

1277
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,360
I was an okay artist.

1278
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,240
Everyone said: "Great! Amazing!"

1279
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,360
I figured I'd been underappreciated
back in Russia.

1280
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,800
'Cause we, Russians, say:

1281
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,880
"This is shit.
This one's a redo.
This one's... passable."

1282
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,040
In America, they all said:
"Great! Amazing! We love you!"

1283
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,600
I was like: "Shit! I'm staying!"

1284
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,840
But then I noticed they said all the same
things to John from Alabama,

1285
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,720
to Khan from India...

1286
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,960
I went: "Crap! I must be doing
something wrong."

1287
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,160
The Anglo-Saxon communication
culture is much more indirect.

1288
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,800
We often step on...

1289
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:54,440
Russian developers often
run into glass doors here

1290
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,840
of what they consider hypocrisy.

1291
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,960
That's not the case.
That's just local culture.

1292
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,360
They believe here that telling someone
their work is bull is extremely rude.

1293
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,240
It's worse than throwing
poop in someone's face.

1294
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,760
It's better to throw poop in someone's
face than shit all over their work.

1295
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,320
In Russia, it's normal.

1296
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,760
They say: "Dude, what you're
doing is nonsense."

1297
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,240
"It'll never take off.
This was a waste of time."

1298
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,600
To us, that's normal.

1299
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,400
But to Americans and the British,
that's extremely offensive.

1300
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,240
So instead they'll tell you:
"This is amazing."

1301
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,120
When you ask a Russian how's it going,
the typical response is: "It's going fine,"

1302
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,920
which means it's going not bad,
it's good.

1303
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,680
You don't say "good", because you
don't want them to think you're bragging.

1304
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:40,240
Only to someone I'm truly close with, I could say:
"You know, things are actually going well!"

1305
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,720
Or the opposite:
"Things are awful!"

1306
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,680
Americans will tell everyone they're doing
"absolutely amazing."

1307
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:52,120
Even if they have fresh bruises
on their face

1308
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,720
from the worst possible morning
you could ever have,

1309
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,760
they'll still say: "Amazing."

1310
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,440
If they're not doing well,
they'll grumble: "Amazing."

1311
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:09,000
Someone told us yesterday that they teach kids
storytelling here, from third or fifth grade.

1312
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,840
- And kids in elementary school
can put together presentations.
- Yep.

1313
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,320
Was that a lie?

1314
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,560
That's actually true.

1315
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,560
And in fact, that's another thing here
guys back at home could really use

1316
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,640
to be successful in big
places like this one,

1317
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,040
is the ability to communicate
effectively.

1318
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:31,720
In Russia, and I know this from experience,
communication is much more direct,

1319
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,920
and they find it really rough
and coarse here.

1320
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,680
They don't try to smooth out
the edges.

1321
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,760
They don't bother
with careful wording.

1322
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,880
They just go: du-du-du-du!

1323
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,280
They often end up unheard by folks here,
just because, woah!

1324
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:50,800
I tried to figure out why that was the case.
In reality, they never teach us that.

1325
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,480
They don't teach us in school
to present ourselves,

1326
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,440
to effectively communicate
our ideas,

1327
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,000
to debate with arguments
but politely.

1328
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,120
They don't teach that.

1329
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,160
You're good at dealing
with bullies outside.

1330
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,880
You know your comebacks
to "whatcha lookin' at?"

1331
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,000
But they don't teach you
how to pitch a startup idea.

1332
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,840
I have a great example
from my own life.

1333
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,240
I was very surprised. My daughter's been
going to school here since she was little.

1334
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,400
I believe she was 8 or 9 at the time.

1335
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,400
Eight.

1336
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,440
She came home from school...

1337
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,800
I had no idea she could do
anything on the computer.

1338
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,840
She came home from school and said: "Parents,
I need you to plug the computer in the big screen."

1339
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,040
"I made a presentation."

1340
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,280
We were like: "What?
What presentation?"

1341
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,960
She plugs the computer in.
She made slides.

1342
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,560
She has a perfectly structured,
clearly technique-driven pitch

1343
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,120
on the subject:
"We need a cat."

1344
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,680
She starts going:
"We need a cat."

1345
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,360
"Here's a set of issues. I'm cold and lonely
in bed at night, so I don't sleep well."

1346
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,760
"And I don't study well."

1347
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,880
"We need a cat."

1348
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,840
"If we get a cat, I'll learn to be responsible
and take care of this small creature."

1349
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,120
"Du-du-du-du-du."

1350
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,280
So she pitched me a cat
in five minutes.

1351
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,680
- I was super against pets.
- So insidious!

1352
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,800
And now I have a cat! (laughs)

1353
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,640
After I landed at the San Francisco
airport,

1354
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,640
my partner and I went
to rent a car.

1355
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,080
We came to this booth,

1356
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,880
where the salesman told us
about the insurance,

1357
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,200
how much it's gonna cost,
and so on and so forth.

1358
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,960
And he said: "What do you do?
Why did you come?"

1359
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,880
We said we were programmers
from Belarus

1360
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,640
and we came to show
our startup to the world. So...

1361
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,560
He went: "Guys! You're programmers, huh?
I have this crazy idea..."

1362
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,520
He starts talking about his super idea.
"Pitching" it, as they call it.

1363
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,560
He's pitching his startup.

1364
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,320
We're in shock!

1365
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,839
If some small car rental salesman

1366
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,760
is carrying around a startup idea
and tries to pitch it,

1367
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:00,520
then, damn, this place
is truly full of

1368
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,520
ideas, active people and dreamers.

1369
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:11,280
To stay as up to date as possible, you need
to maintain social connections and network

1370
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:14,159
with everyone.

1371
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,280
So far, this is one of our biggest
impressions from the Valley:

1372
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,399
even waiting in a restaurant line,

1373
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,639
for a table to free up,

1374
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,560
they start talking to each other,

1375
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,320
knowing that this waiting-in-line
small talk

1376
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,599
could help them out in the future.

1377
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,720
It could help with networking.

1378
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,720
But it's so cynical!

1379
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,880
Well, small talk is a cultural thing.

1380
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,320
It's not about getting something out of it.
They're not trying to hook you.

1381
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,159
But you're right, people here are always
trying to meet someone useful.

1382
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,320
Isn't it cynical?

1383
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,600
I don't find it cynical,
because everyone everywhere

1384
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,240
needs something from others.

1385
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,280
You can try and meet
people in Moscow

1386
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,120
because you wanna get
a contract with them

1387
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,320
or you're hoping for a recommendation
or a promotion.

1388
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,800
Down here, they're just
upfront about it.

1389
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,400
It takes a lot more time and effort to move this
relationship along here than it is in Moscow.

1390
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,080
In Moscow, you can meet with someone over coffee,
talk with them for 40 minutes and sign a contract.

1391
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,680
Or agree to sign a contract

1392
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,200
after one dinner.

1393
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,520
I'm sure many have.

1394
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,600
Down here, in most cases,
it takes, like, five years

1395
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,840
of being in the same environment, being around,
taking your kids to the same school,

1396
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,600
playing at the same golf club,

1397
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,400
going to the same pottery class,
whatever,

1398
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,160
and only then you go:
"Hey, John, so what do you do again?"

1399
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,840
- Though you know exactly what they do?
- Of course.

1400
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,080
Ugh!

1401
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,280
There's something called
UberPool.

1402
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,960
You call a taxi,
but you don't ride alone —

1403
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,080
you pick someone up along the way
and you split the cost of the ride.

1404
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,040
Say, if a normal Uber ride costs $10,
an UberPool ride costs $5.

1405
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,160
- He just picks people up?
- Yeah. Along the way.

1406
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,560
It takes longer, it's inconvenient,
there's someone else in the car and so on.

1407
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,480
Anyway, I called an UberPool.
We were scraping by at the time.

1408
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,200
I paid the $5. We picked up
another dude.

1409
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,320
He also called an UberPool.
We start talking.

1410
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,160
"What do you do?"
"I'm an entrepreneur."
We're both entrepreneurs.

1411
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,040
Ten minutes later, we're making
plans for world domination.

1412
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,440
...When neither of us can pay
for a solo taxi ride.

1413
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,400
- Did the driver turn around
and offer funding?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1414
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,000
He offered to drive us for free.

1415
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,040
- So everyone's obsessed with it?
- Yeah.

1416
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,520
It's like Hollywood
for the entertainment industry.

1417
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,400
But it's, like, painful?

1418
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,640
- Painful how?
- That everyone's obsessed.

1419
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:51,200
Yes and no. This kind of
concentration of unified context

1420
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,400
makes people think
in one direction.

1421
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,760
That's what produces these
cutting-edge ideas.

1422
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,400
Thanks to this context, everyone's
thinking about it all the time.

1423
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,720
You walk around and you can't
not think about it.

1424
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,000
That's why I think you get
these cutting-edge ideas.

1425
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,640
That's why the Valley is so great
and performs so...

1426
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,520
That's why you can't
replicate the Valley.

1427
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,480
You can't replicate such
density of context.

1428
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,240
A week in these cafés
is worth much more

1429
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,720
than a month or a year at
Four Seasons Moscow in coffee,

1430
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,920
because you soak it all in here.

1431
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,400
How does it work?

1432
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,400
You sit at a table at that
pancake place over there.

1433
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,280
And what? Someone useful
can walk in?

1434
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,640
There's 74,000 people living in Palo Alto.
About half of them are in IT.

1435
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,120
On our way here,

1436
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,720
half of the people in that Starbucks
work at Google, LinkedIn, Facebook.

1437
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,920
They connect very easily.

1438
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,840
We have a friend who used to work
as a barista at a Starbucks,

1439
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,600
but had an idea for a startup.

1440
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,720
Where did he meet
his first investor?

1441
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,520
In that very Starbucks.

1442
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,040
Some guy from Google just
walked in to get a coffee.

1443
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,160
Vanilla-cappuccino 2-in-1.

1444
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,920
And signed him a check
for $100,000.

1445
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,520
That's a small sum, right?

1446
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
It's a tiny sum, yeah.

1447
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,120
I think he lended him
some of his pocket money,

1448
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,000
his bonus for that month.

1449
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,200
Did the startup take off?
Honestly! Be honest now!

1450
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,480
We did a number of projects. Some of them
worked out, some of them didn't.

1451
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,400
Did the Starbucks guy's project
take off?

1452
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,680
We're currently working
with him, yes.

1453
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,600
- Oh! As..?
- He just got initial funding from...

1454
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,760
- You work as an investor?
- As partners.

1455
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,520
We're doing visual graphics for him.

1456
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
What's the startup for?
Video games?

1457
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,720
AI.

1458
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,520
This place attracts
the most ambitious,

1459
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,600
the most passionate, the people that want
to change the world or the humanity.

1460
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,520
Whenever you move up one step, there's always
someone one step above to compare yourself to.

1461
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,920
You exist in this progression.
You're surrounded by people who...

1462
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,200
You might say: "My company's worth
tens of millions of dollars."

1463
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,360
Someone turns around and says:
"Mine's worth hundreds of millions."

1464
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,680
And you're, like, okay,
we've got work to do.

1465
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,960
You get constant reminders that
you can do better, faster, stronger.

1466
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,840
You come to a party,
you meet people...

1467
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,440
There's some guy,
you shake his hand,

1468
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,000
and he might say:
"We raised 20 million yesterday."

1469
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,280
You're like:
"Okay, I'm outta here."

1470
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,880
That's normal.

1471
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,080
Something I noticed
working with Google,

1472
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,680
these days, instead of hiring
people with one success

1473
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,720
they hire those with five failures.

1474
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,440
'Cause these people know
what they did wrong.

1475
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,480
If they can analyze and process it,
next time, they'll act differently.

1476
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,520
This is a new trend in the Valley.

1477
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,840
People care about
failed projects,

1478
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,560
and if you've analyzed it,
they'll want to support you.

1479
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,160
'Cause you want risk-takers now.

1480
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,640
Everything's been done. You can use templates
to make a typical game or a typical film.

1481
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,400
People don't get hyped for those.
You have to think outside the box.

1482
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,640
How? By trial and error.

1483
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,880
You mean someone with two failed projects is more
useful than someone with three successes?

1484
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,000
Five failures are better
than one success.

1485
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,880
With three successes, you're probably
on par with Google yourself

1486
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,840
and you can invest in new
startups yourself.

1487
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,240
Another important thing
is tolerance to failure.

1488
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,800
Meaning, failing in the Valley
is not shameful.

1489
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,120
So for example, I'm checking out
résumés,

1490
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:13,400
and someone comes to an interview and says,
"My startup failed, so I'm looking for a job,"

1491
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,000
or, "I've had two major failures."

1492
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:20,320
I don't think to myself:
"Why would I hire you then?"

1493
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,320
I think that this person...

1494
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:28,080
They have experienced failure and are therefore
more valuable than someone who hasn't.

1495
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,440
- So he's not a loser, he's a guy with experience?
- He's a guy with experience.

1496
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:35,840
And also he's proven that he can get up
after a failure and move forward.

1497
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,960
That's super important, because given
what this place is all about,

1498
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,960
failing is pretty much a mandatory
part of the game.

1499
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,080
You're constantly failing because you're
trying out new and crazy ideas all the time.

1500
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,320
If you're not failing, then you're not
taking enough risks.

1501
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,280
That's super important.

1502
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,160
And the final thing that,
in my opinion,

1503
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:03,280
has a big effect on local business
and the community itself

1504
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,680
is the acceptance and tolerance

1505
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:11,960
towards the crazy, the unconventional,
the things you're not used to —

1506
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,080
all this wacky stuff.

1507
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,920
'Cause all great ideas
sound crazy at first.

1508
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,400
If you can't accept people
that dress differently,

1509
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,160
or act differently,
or something like that,

1510
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,000
a community like that probably won't
support a crazy new idea like:

1511
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,840
"Hey, let's make a social network

1512
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,760
"where people will use their real
names and share pictures?"

1513
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,960
When Facebook was just starting,
this idea sounded crazy.

1514
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,680
No one used their real names
on the internet.

1515
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,960
But venture capitalists believe
in those ideas and offer funding

1516
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,960
because it's common knowledge here
that crazy ideas are a good thing.

1517
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,240
And they know that they can fail.

1518
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,120
Are there as many broken dreams
as in La La Land?

1519
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:03,480
When you move here to become a star of the industry
but end up making coffee at a Starbucks.

1520
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,520
Yes.

1521
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,080
This is what I talked about
at the start.

1522
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:14,800
Unlike La La Land, where your success depended
on the backup of producers and studios...

1523
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,520
You didn't have YouTube
to put together a team

1524
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,360
and start filming interviews
and become a star.

1525
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,640
They didn't have that in Hollywood.

1526
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,880
Well, unlike that scenario,
here, you've always had it.

1527
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,120
You come here alone.

1528
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,320
You rent a garage.
Or you don't even rent a garage

1529
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,360
and just sit at home
like these guys

1530
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,880
and you work on your idea

1531
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,680
until it become something big.

1532
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,840
You're the master
of your fate here.

1533
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,920
That's the biggest difference
with Hollywood.

1534
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,360
(title card music)

1535
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:59,240
(voices, car engine, street sounds)

1536
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,320
I was in shock at first.

1537
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,840
My friend and I, we used to smoke
cigarettes back then,

1538
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,080
left our apartment...

1539
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,640
Smoking cigarettes is extremely
unpopular here.

1540
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,200
If you're standing with a cigarette outside,
people will recoil from you,

1541
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,680
like you're shooting up heroine
in the middle of the street.

1542
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,280
It's that strong.

1543
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,320
So we're standing there smoking,
and a police car pulls up.

1544
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,040
This huge SUV, bunch of lights.

1545
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,720
The cop's a Navy SEAL: bulletproof vest,
tattoos — scary stuff.

1546
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,000
He turns to us and says:
"How's it going?"

1547
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,880
We drop the cigarettes and go:

1548
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,960
"We good! We good!
We don't want any trouble!"

1549
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,840
"There are 'no smoking' signs that way and
that way. We thought we'd smoke here."

1550
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,240
He's goes: "Guys... I just asked
how you were doing."

1551
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,720
We're like: "We're doing fine. Why?"

1552
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,800
"Great. I just wanted to remind you
that there's no crosswalk here."

1553
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,920
"So when you go back across, please,
make sure a car doesn't hit you."

1554
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,160
"This is a dangerous stretch.
Please, be careful."

1555
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,920
Salutes us and leaves.

1556
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,120
We stood there in silence for, like, five minutes,
trying to process what just happened.

1557
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,480
(laughs) "Why did he pull up?"

1558
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,680
"He was going on his business, noticed we were
standing somewhere we could get hit,

1559
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,600
"told us to be careful crossing
the road and left?"

1560
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,960
[*Protagonist of a series of Soviet poems for children,]
[an exemplary citizen that helped others in need.]
[The author eventually turned him into a police officer]
[that continued doing good deeds above and beyond]
[his regular duties.]
"Is he a real-life Uncle Stiopa*?"

1561
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,720
Turned out, yeah. Down here, a police
officer is a respected job.

1562
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,560
They salute the police.
They love 'em.

1563
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,680
If you wanna get any sort of
professional help here,

1564
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,040
you should expect
that it's gonna cost you.

1565
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,280
Even supposedly menial jobs

1566
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,880
like waste collectors, plumbers
or gardeners.

1567
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,440
Gardeners charge $200 for a visit.

1568
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,720
- The place will get overgrown without them?
- Yeah.

1569
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,480
It IS overgrown, actually.

1570
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,880
The landlord doesn't hire help.
These are all weeds.

1571
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,200
[*In Russian, the word sounds Medieval,]
[and thus humorous.]
(chuckles) "Landlord!*"

1572
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,480
- So okay. You have two kids, right?
- Yes.

1573
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,440
How much money do you need here
to support a family of four

1574
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,320
without shelling out like a rapper?

1575
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,360
Twenty.

1576
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,120
- Twenty thousand bucks, if you don't go crazy.
- Yeah.

1577
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,200
Thirty, if you spend freely?

1578
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,600
Yeah.

1579
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,720
Damn.

1580
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,200
Depends on your definition
of "freely."

1581
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:13,200
If you make $50,000 a month, that means
you get $30,000 post-tax?

1582
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,880
- More like $25,000.
- Got it.

1583
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,520
- So for a decent living, you have to make
at least $500,000 a year?
- Yeah.

1584
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,880
- From two salaries.
- Damn.

1585
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,400
- Do Facebook engineers make
that kind of money?
- Yes.

1586
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:31,280
- A typical engineer?
- Well, a typical engineer makes
around $250,000 a year.

1587
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,000
I.e. twenty-ish a month.

1588
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,680
But that's a tenner post-tax?

1589
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,360
You spend those on housing,
taxes and, say, food,

1590
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,320
but you also get options
and bonuses.

1591
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,320
[Options are company shares given to employees]
[to motivate and keep them from leaving;]
[paid out separately from normal salary]
They're automatically put
in you savings account.

1592
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,160
[Options are company shares given to employees]
[to motivate and keep them from leaving;]
[paid out separately from normal salary]
There's also a separate
pension savings account.

1593
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,400
[Options are company shares given to employees]
[to motivate and keep them from leaving;]
[paid out separately from normal salary]
So in total, a Facebook engineer
could make a million a year.

1594
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,240
But they'll still only get
about $300,000 in cash.

1595
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,360
How much do programmers
make in the Valley?

1596
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,040
It depends, but programmers do have
really big salaries here.

1597
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,720
That's because competition
is mostly for talent

1598
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,480
rather than markets
and whatever else.

1599
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,560
Or users.

1600
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,720
By 'talent' I mean any kind of
professional.

1601
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,920
The starting salary of a software engineer
who's just graduated college

1602
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,440
is around $120,000,
something like that.

1603
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,440
- A year?
- Yes. And from there...

1604
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,120
- Important note: 120 is pre-tax, right?
- Yes.

1605
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,040
Post-tax, that's 60?

1606
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,920
With $120,000, they probably get
$80 to 90 thousand,

1607
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,400
'cause it's a progressive tax scale.
It starts from 30%.

1608
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,440
What if you're coming in from Russia
and already have experience?

1609
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,040
Then it's $200 to 300 thousand.

1610
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,720
And once you start producing results...

1611
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,880
It all depends on your performance.

1612
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,120
Down here, no one really cares
about your titles or credentials,

1613
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,600
or your accolades or whatever.

1614
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,200
If you don't produce quality work,
you won't be making any money.

1615
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,800
If you do produce quality work, no one will care
that you don't have a diploma.

1616
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,560
You'll make half a million,
a million and so on.

1617
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,280
What are the housing prices?

1618
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,200
I used to rent a small room
for $3000.

1619
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,640
The best part about it was...

1620
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,600
- Room or apartment?
- A room.

1621
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,000
- But it was right next to Google.
- But you had roommates?
- Yeah, I did.

1622
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,880
I know you can rent a decent
house for $5000 to $7000.

1623
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,240
But it's something a ways.
In the center, it's 10k and up.

1624
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,480
That's just rent.

1625
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,960
- What about buying?
- Five to ten million dollars.

1626
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,600
[*~1300 square feet.]
- For a 120-meter* shack?
- For a fixer-upper, yeah. Something pretty
from the get-go will cost more.

1627
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:40,240
120 meters, cardboard walls, three meters away
from the next house — this could cost 5 million?

1628
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,640
...small lawn. Yeah.

1629
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,840
Most of the people doing well here
are the IT crowd.

1630
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,000
Half of the menial workers
live below the poverty line.

1631
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,080
It's the other side of the Valley.

1632
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,760
Palo Alto was a small town
just 30 years ago.

1633
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,800
If you watch James Franco's movie.
He was born here.

1634
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,520
He made a film about the Palo Alto
of his childhood.

1635
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,560
It's a typical small town
where IT took off, is all.

1636
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,320
The IT crowd used to comprise
10% of the population. Now, it's 50%.

1637
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,800
The rest aren't doing as well.

1638
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,240
How is it possible that over here,
houses cost millions of dollars,

1639
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,320
cross the road,
and it's a total A?

1640
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,040
I still can't wrap my head around
this side of America.

1641
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,520
It's not just this place. You walk down
the street in LA, it's all classy and fancy,

1642
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,320
cross the road, it's homeless people, crazies,
and someone's pointing a gun at you.

1643
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,280
You walk five meters back,
and it's scents and corgis.

1644
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,320
That's because...
(both laugh)

1645
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,720
Because what?

1646
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:37,360
It's because municipalities get financing
from their respective neighborhoods.

1647
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,680
Palo Alto is where the IT crowd lives.
They can pay for the police and the firemen.

1648
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,280
Happy firemen.

1649
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,120
East Palo Alto doesn't have IT.

1650
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:49,360
They have a lot of crime. So they
can't fund police or medicine.

1651
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,960
- But they're neighborhoods of the same city!
- They get funding separately, each has its own.

1652
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,680
That's why it's hard to imagine
this in Moscow:

1653
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,520
you can go here, but you never
go there, even in broad daylight.

1654
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,680
Yeah, Moscow doesn't
have ghettos.

1655
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,360
Yeah. In San Francisco,
even Americans say:

1656
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,480
"Stay away from that place.
Always."

1657
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:11,120
Until very recently, East Palo Alto
was the "murder capital" of the US.

1658
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,720
Beating New York and such.

1659
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,920
They were the first city in the US to use
the automatic police alert system

1660
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,200
with gunshot sound
triangulation.

1661
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,880
You shoot a gun, and there's
a police car on its way.

1662
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,920
If you wanna call the cops
in East Palo Alto,

1663
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,640
because you're being mugged or something,
shoot in the air or the mugger.

1664
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,920
It instantly calls a car?
Wait, there are mics in the air?

1665
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:39,200
It's a audio system that triangulates your
location based on the gunshot sound.

1666
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,360
- Holy crap.
- I don't know if they're still using it,
but they used to.

1667
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,000
- But you cross the road, and there's
Apple's HQ.
- Across the road. Yeah.

1668
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,600
Well, Apple's in Cupertino.
But Facebook's here. Yeah.

1669
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,280
You cross the road,
and there's Facebook's HQ.

1670
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,680
Facebook, Stanford.

1671
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,080
The poverty threshold here
is $200,000.

1672
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,240
So if you're someone who makes
less than $200,000...

1673
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,160
- A year?
- A year.

1674
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,920
Wait, let's break it down for clarity.

1675
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:07,000
- If you make less than $17,500
a month...
- A month.

1676
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,360
If my math's correct.

1677
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,880
[His math was wrong:]
[$200,000 a year = $16,666 a month]
- Approximately.
- Give or take, yeah.

1678
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,120
[His math was wrong:]
[$200,000 a year = $16,666 a month]
...you're poor?

1679
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,240
[His math was wrong:]
[$200,000 a year = $16,666 a month]
Not just poor. You need
to be subsidized.

1680
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,240
[His math was wrong:]
[$200,000 a year = $16,666 a month]
- If you make less than 17,5k..?
- Yes.

1681
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,080
- If you make less than 17,5k..?
- Yes.

1682
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,840
But it makes sense, because...

1683
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,440
First, we're not taking into account how much
of that you're giving up in taxes.

1684
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,680
There are federal taxes. According
to them, it's a large sum.

1685
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,840
You pay a large a tax from it.

1686
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,400
Super expensive housing,
ridiculous healthcare.

1687
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,400
I don't get sick a lot.
I have great health.

1688
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,560
But I still spend $20,000
a year on healthcare.

1689
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,600
On health insurance?

1690
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:43,040
Yeah. Insurance combined with some
minor things. Totals at 20k.

1691
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,960
You ever filled a cavity
in the Valley?

1692
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,120
No. I do full-body maintenance in Russia
whenever I get the chance.

1693
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,280
'Cause it's also faster.

1694
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,080
Importantly, in Russia, it's not just
cheaper; it's better.

1695
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,200
When you come to a doctor
in the US,

1696
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:00,120
you spend an hour in line,
even though you pay $1000 for it.

1697
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,960
Narking is another thing here.

1698
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,640
- They do that here?
- Of course they do.

1699
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,760
It's not just there. It's great!

1700
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,880
When you first come here, you're like:
"What? How can you nark out your neighbor?"

1701
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,440
But then you realize that it's
super convenient.

1702
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:21,720
Let's say, I'm pissed that my neighbor leaves his trash bins out in a way

1703
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,600
that they stink up the place
where I cook barbecue.

1704
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,280
Right?

1705
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,400
I can tell he's violating
some regulations.

1706
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,080
What are my options? I can
come up to him and go:

1707
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,440
"Hey, buddy, could move your bins?"

1708
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,080
He'll tell me: "Screw you."
We'll get in a fist fight.

1709
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:39,680
At best, we'll have an argument
and harass each other for a while.

1710
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,520
Instead, I can call the sheriff
and go:

1711
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:48,200
"Sheriff, bro, my neighbor's stinking my place up
with his trash bins. Could you take care of it?"

1712
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:52,920
The sheriff goes to him and says: "Dude,
move your trash bins or next time I'll fine you."

1713
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,960
- Problem solved. You have a wonderful
moderator.
- You ever did that?

1714
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,120
No. But I plan on narking one
of my neighbors out.

1715
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,200
- You're okay with it?
- Perfectly okay.

1716
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:06,240
That's something you grow into. First, you need
to learn to trust the sheriff as your friend

1717
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,480
and realize that this dude doesn't
expect you to bribe him.

1718
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,560
That's difficult, you agree?

1719
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,960
It's very difficult!

1720
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,560
One of my first trips was...

1721
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,840
I really wanted to do this, I did some
research and found Jobs' houses.

1722
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,000
Jobs' old houses.

1723
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,600
Jobs' current houses.

1724
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,840
The reason this was so
illuminating was that...

1725
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,600
Sadly, this was right after
Jobs had passed away.

1726
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,280
[Steve Jobs died in 2011]
I come to this house.

1727
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,960
[Steve Jobs died in 2011]
First thing that struck was, rather than
a house of glass and concrete,

1728
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,760
[Steve Jobs died in 2011]
this was more like
a hobbit's cottage.

1729
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,720
A really conservative little old house.

1730
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,720
You may know that his car of choice
was Mercedes 500SL.

1731
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,560
And he'd always get a new one to avoid
putting number plates on it.

1732
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,960
Drove around without plates.
Parked in handicapped spaces.

1733
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,080
Whenever it was time to install
the number plates,

1734
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,640
in six or twelve months,
I can't remember exactly,

1735
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,680
instead of installing them,
he'd return the car to the dealership,

1736
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:00,240
the dealership would sell it
as Jobs' ex-car

1737
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,520
and give Jobs a new Mercedes.

1738
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,720
The fact that it was a hobbit's cottage
rather than a glass-and-concrete house,

1739
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,280
was that a quirk of his mentality
or classic IT guy psyche?

1740
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,480
Lack of time?

1741
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,960
Exactly. It was good enough.
That's like his 50 black turtlenecks.

1742
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:21,320
Another one of his houses,
the one he grew up in,
his parents' house,

1743
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,960
was also this tiny little house
with a garage where it all started.

1744
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,840
That's the most fascinating thing in the Valley to me —
going to these places where you see

1745
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,880
this plain house and this plain garage,
where they started.

1746
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,160
They didn't come up with any intermediate
steps before they'd get to work.

1747
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,600
They didn't think, "Oh, I need to raise funds first,"
or, "I need to get this extra degree."

1748
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,280
They sat down in their garage and started working
because they were excited about it there and then.

1749
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,680
I believe that that's how great
companies are created.

1750
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,000
It's exciting to witness that.

1751
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:53,160
Someone told us you could meet Sergey Brin
out in the city alone, without security.

1752
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,640
Yeah, he took his kids to our
school for two years.

1753
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,960
Then their mom said the school had weak math
and transferred them to a different one.

1754
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,240
The only security he had was this

1755
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,680
60-ish-year-old guy
in a white Prius,

1756
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,560
that always slept, or pretended to sleep,
in the parking lot,

1757
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,840
and some suspicious gardeners would walk around
in the forest, doing... something... in the forest.

1758
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,280
- You think it was his security?
- It was definitely his security.

1759
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,520
Because as soon as they
transferred their kids,

1760
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,400
both the gardeners and the guy
in the white car disappeared.

1761
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,000
They do it carefully.

1762
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,360
- Discreetly?
- Super discreetly!

1763
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,920
Unless you specifically
look for them

1764
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,040
and go: "Uh-huh! This guy's new!"
every day,

1765
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,160
you'll never notice them.

1766
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,000
Zuckerberg has a lot more security.

1767
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,040
They, like, put him in a van.

1768
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,080
There's another van
following his van.

1769
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,120
He has sort of presidential ambitions
in terms of security.

1770
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,520
Whereas Brin and Page...

1771
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,320
Tim Cook goes to my gym.

1772
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,880
[Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple]
Only he goes there at 5 AM
to avoid being bugged.

1773
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,440
[Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple]
- With pitches? With startup offers?
- Yeah.

1774
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,840
[Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple]
Which is weird, right?

1775
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:02,200
On the show Billions, New York traders
make fun of each other, going:

1776
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:05,720
"Wait, you go to a gym
with other people in it?"

1777
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,200
"Are you poor or something?"

1778
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:13,000
Whereas Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple,
mind you, goes to Equinox

1779
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,360
that charges $100 a month
and anyone can afford it.

1780
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,760
Why does he go there?

1781
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,520
It's convenient and comfortable for him.
Why should he do anything special?

1782
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,120
They don't appreciate
showoffs here.

1783
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,480
I have lots of neighbors that make
a lot more money than me,

1784
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,080
but they all drive regular cars
and wear regular clothes.

1785
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,200
Showing off your wealth is
frowned upon in the Valley.

1786
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,280
They'll point fingers at you and go:
"Ugh! Showoff."

1787
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,360
- This is a fairly well-off neighborhood.
- Yeah.

1788
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,520
Mildly speaking.

1789
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,600
But when it comes to fences...

1790
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,760
I can see a small picket
fence over there,

1791
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,280
but they don't put up tall
ones here, do they?

1792
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,280
Yeah, it's actually prohibited.

1793
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,920
It was a tradition at first, but when Russians
started coming in, they passed a law.

1794
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,440
First, the are wild deer.

1795
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,400
Tall fences disturb them.

1796
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,400
Second, they make your neighbors
uncomfortable.

1797
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:06,880
Everyone has to maintain an open path
through their land here.

1798
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,000
The law requires that you have
a path for horseback riders.

1799
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:16,240
You gotta spend your own money to build
a special path that meets certain guidelines

1800
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,680
that's comfortable for horsies
to hoof along.

1801
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,520
If you do a poor job maintaining it,
your neighbors will nark you out:

1802
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,840
"We maintain our side of the path.
This asshole doesn't. Please, fine him."

1803
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,280
The Valley has an insane
shortage of girls.

1804
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,400
The ratio is something
like 70 to 30.

1805
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,280
- Around 70.
- For real?

1806
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,520
How do guys live here?

1807
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,400
This joke from Silicon Valley:

1808
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:42,680
"It was a great party last night.
There were eight girls at once!"
(Miheyenko laughs)

1809
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,200
So that's pretty much real?

1810
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,400
[*Saint Petersburg.]
It is close to real. It was a bit of a shock
for me too after Moscow and Peter*.

1811
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:51,280
When you're used to Russian
beautie...ful sights,

1812
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,000
you move here and you're super confused,
like: where are they?

1813
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,760
Are they hiding them from you?
What's going on?

1814
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,320
How do you meet girls over here?

1815
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,400
I understand they're a minority here?

1816
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,960
So I'm not an expert.

1817
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,480
I'm desperately married.

1818
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,680
But my friends complain to me
about that all the time.

1819
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,120
They say: "That's it. I'm done.
I'm booking a flight to Odessa."

1820
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,840
I'm like: "What? What flight?
We have a ton of work to do!"

1821
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,360
He goes: "I can't take this anymore.
I'm going to Odessa. Give me one week."

1822
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,200
(laughs) I... I...

1823
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,640
I go, "What happened?"

1824
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,520
He says, "Let me show you
my Tinder."

1825
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,080
He starts swiping through Tinder,
and yeah,

1826
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,920
if I was looking for someone
to try and start a relationship,

1827
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,440
I doubt I would use
Tinder for that,

1828
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,560
but if I did, I would spend
A LOT of time swiping.

1829
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,320
There are just few women here
demographically.

1830
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,360
Ever since the gold rush, right?

1831
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,360
Yeah. No one knows how many
arrived by land.

1832
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,200
They only registered those
that arrived by sea.

1833
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,960
In '49, 70 thousand people arrived.
Only a thousand of them were women.

1834
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,160
[He's talking about 1849]
In '49, 70 thousand people arrived.
Only a thousand of them were women.

1835
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,520
- That's...
- One to seventy.

1836
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,080
One to seventy!

1837
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,160
And they were someone's wives.
(laughs)

1838
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,040
There were no free women.

1839
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:10,280
That's why all the way back in 1849, they had
an actual gay neighborhood in San Francisco.

1840
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,200
The American LGBT community has been
drawn to this place ever since,

1841
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,640
because 'queer' has been
normal for so long here.

1842
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,800
So the only practical option
is bringing along a wife?

1843
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:22,920
Yeah.

1844
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,400
Or occasionally go: "I can't take this
anymore! I'm going to Odessa!"

1845
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,240
[*Capitals of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.]
[The implication is that the "unwind city"]
[will depend on the country you came from.]
Or Minsk, or Moscow, or Kiev*.

1846
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,920
I moved with my lady.

1847
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,240
We later broke up.

1848
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,000
My current girlfriend is...
Well, she's Russian too.

1849
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,720
It's an issue.
It's a big issue here.

1850
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,120
But on the bright side,

1851
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,240
nothing's distracting you
from work.

1852
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,320
Not even nocturnal emissions?

1853
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,480
Yeah. At some point,
it all just stops.

1854
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:50,040
You wake up and all you think about
is ploughing on.

1855
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,840
(title card music)

1856
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,520
- Hey, I saw birches over there.
- Yeah!

1857
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,920
Birches are everywhere, dude.

1858
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,280
Every country I lived in, I've lived in five,
I had a birch tree next to my house.

1859
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:09,360
[*Diminutive of berioza, "birch tree."]
Why did they tell me in school that a beriozka*
could only grow on Russian soil?

1860
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,680
Because a beriozka is
a metaphysical concept.

1861
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:17,160
You do miss the beriozka birches when you're anywhere but in Russia.

1862
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:21,360
You wanna be careful with them. You come to Russia,
those beriozkas, they pull you in and don't let go.

1863
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,000
Dude, stop torturing me!
(Doronichev laughs)

1864
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,520
So it's another school
myth then?

1865
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,560
Yeah, it's a very common plant.
Birch tree.

1866
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,560
(Dud') No one identifies it
with Russia?

1867
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,480
(Doronichev) Well, you and I do.

1868
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,400
- (Dud') But Americans wouldn't
understand why we..?
- No, they wouldn't.

1869
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,760
It's like if you monopolized the palm tree
and started telling everyone that palm trees

1870
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,000
were inherently Russian.

1871
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,120
Very few people intentionally
create bubbles.

1872
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,440
A lot of the time,
they happen on their own.

1873
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,000
- For example?
- Usually, they're created by investors.

1874
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,080
- Is there a textbook example of a bubble?
- Theranos.

1875
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,600
They made a book about it...

1876
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,760
"Made a book?"

1877
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,800
Made a movie, wrote a book.

1878
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,040
The investigation.

1879
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,840
Founder's being sued.

1880
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,200
Elizabeth Holmes,

1881
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,360
a blonde in a turtleneck
like Jobs'

1882
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,560
with intense grey eyes

1883
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,240
and an unnaturally
low-pitched voice,

1884
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:18,320
was obsessed with the idea that huge
machines for blood testing were stupid

1885
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:22,280
and we needed something that would let
anyone donate a little blood at home

1886
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,680
to do 150 different tests.

1887
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,040
Parading this vision,
she collected investor money.

1888
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,200
She managed to lure in
some incredible talent.

1889
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,160
She had a seriously
impressive team.

1890
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:38,960
She'd sign hundred-million-dollar
contracts with pharmacy chains

1891
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,080
who'd say: "Here, we're happy to pay
for your machines in advance."

1892
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:49,080
Something like nine years later, she's got nada:
no machines, no technology, nothing.

1893
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,760
The company's worth $9 billion.
She's worth $4.5 billion.

1894
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,080
[In 2015, Forbes named then 31-year-old Holmes]
[the youngest and wealthiest female billionaire in the US.]
[Several months later, The Wall Street Journal released]
[an investigation that brought about the exposure of]
[Theranos. Forbes subsequently revised Holmes' net worth]
[to be zero. Theranos shut down in 2018. As of spring of]
[2020, Holmes is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud,]
[court hearing pending. She is facing 20 years in prison]
In real money?

1895
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,160
[In 2015, Forbes named then 31-year-old Holmes]
[the youngest and wealthiest female billionaire in the US.]
[Several months later, The Wall Street Journal released]

[to be zero. Theranos shut down in 2018. As of spring of]
[2020, Holmes is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud,]
[court hearing pending. She is facing 20 years in prison]
Well, she cashed in some
of the money, yeah.

1896
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,960
[In 2015, Forbes named then 31-year-old Holmes]
[the youngest and wealthiest female billionaire in the US.]

[2020, Holmes is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud,]
[court hearing pending. She is facing 20 years in prison]
This was a textbook bubble.

1897
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,400
[In 2015, Forbes named then 31-year-old Holmes]
[the youngest and wealthiest female billionaire in the US.]

[2020, Holmes is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud,]
[court hearing pending. She is facing 20 years in prison]
She was blowing it up
in hopes that...

1898
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:08,840
There's an expression in the Valley,
"fake it till you make it."

1899
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,160
"Pretend until you actually do it."

1900
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,000
Is Tesla a bubble?

1901
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,120
Tesla has a product, it has customers,
it has an army of fans.

1902
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,720
It's sold hundreds of
thousands of cars.

1903
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,480
What about the share sales?
Aren't they essentially donations?

1904
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,240
They're not exactly donations.

1905
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,320
Tesla has awful financial management.
Just awful.

1906
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:34,240
In terms of financial management,
Tesla operates like a small startup,

1907
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:37,040
even though it's a huge
car manufacturer.

1908
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,440
That's inexcusable irresponsibility.

1909
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:43,560
The company's bank account has enough
money to last it just three or four months.

1910
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,520
That's an indefensible level of risk
for such a company.

1911
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,960
At the same time, they have
a fairly reliable product.

1912
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,240
They have a huge international
network of charging stations.

1913
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,800
I mean, the product's cool, right?

1914
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,880
- Someone will buy Tesla if they start to...
- The Chinese?

1915
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,680
- China's out.
- Why?

1916
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,280
Big politics got involved.

1917
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,880
Trump's grabbed hold of the Valley
and all this stuff, and charged the...

1918
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,320
There's this committee called CFIUS.

1919
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,840
It's a trade commission that decides

1920
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,800
which export deals are okay
and which aren't.

1921
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:26,160
They recently said that, in addition to the defense
industry, the state should also oversee IT.

1922
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:31,720
If you're an American company
that develops AI technology,

1923
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,560
like autopilots or whatever
with potential for military use,

1924
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:41,160
they will have to approve the sale of your
company and even your stock.

1925
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,760
That's why local Chinese venture funds
are closing one after the other.

1926
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,720
- Stas! You work for Tesla.
- Yes.

1927
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,600
[STANISLAV YERIOMIN]
[31 years old]
- Stas! You work for Tesla.
- Yes.

1928
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,720
[STANISLAV YERIOMIN]
[31 years old]
- As an engineer.
- No.

1929
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:50,640
[STANISLAV YERIOMIN]
[Works for Tesla]
- As an engineer.
- No.

1930
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,760
[STANISLAV YERIOMIN]
[Works for Tesla]
- What then?
- Engineering manager.

1931
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,720
[STANISLAV YERIOMIN]
[Works for Tesla]
- You supervise engineers.
- More or less.

1932
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,160
- You supervise engineers.
- More or less.

1933
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,720
In plain terms,

1934
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:03,040
your army of engineers stuffs this beauty
with all the features that we know of.

1935
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:07,480
In fact, my army is responsible for

1936
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,040
everything starting and running
properly on this thing.

1937
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,280
All of the software in this car.

1938
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,280
Damn!

1939
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,240
We're touching the future right now,
aren't we? Or rather the present.

1940
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,840
Actually, for me, this is the past. (laughs)

1941
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:28,920
'Cause I first saw the current firmware
about six months ago.

1942
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,760
Right?

1943
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:34,160
'Cause we constantly update it
and add new features

1944
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:40,920
and new cool things and roll them out
for users all over the world.

1945
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,600
You can't see this,

1946
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:46,600
but I basically have this
huge tablet over here.

1947
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,600
And... What is it showing?

1948
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:52,600
Actually, it's showing that we're on Mars
and providing navigation on Mars.

1949
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:56,160
It's one of the car's Easter eggs,

1950
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,160
to show that you're on Mars.

1951
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,000
- This is an actual map of Mars.
- Why? What's the idea?

1952
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,000
It's a reference to SpaceX.

1953
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,040
If we go to About This Car,

1954
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,640
it will show the properties
of one of SpaceX's

1955
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,760
ships.

1956
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,960
(Yeriomin) How about we get
warm and comfy?

1957
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,960
(silence)

1958
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,480
(whirring, sound of fireplace)

1959
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,560
(Dud') Damn!

1960
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,360
It's like those big-screen
fireplaces they hang in offices.

1961
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:27,200
(Yeriomin) Know what's missing?
The smell of burning wood.

1962
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,840
Would've been better.

1963
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:29,720
(Dud') The sound!

1964
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,200
- (Dud') The sound!!
- Yeah, it does sound good. (laughs)

1965
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,760
(Dud') Anyone ever complained they
thought their car was on fire?

1966
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,680
(music starts playing)
(Dud') Damn!

1967
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,560
- Are those vegetable patches?
- They are! For gardeners.

1968
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,400
That's normal here.
Say, you're a gardener,

1969
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:49,000
you wanna dig around in dirt a little
and grow something to unwind.

1970
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,440
You go outside and garden.

1971
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,480
- Some employee enjoys gardening...
- Yeah.

1972
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,120
They have some gardening patches out here
and they come out on breaks to...

1973
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,080
(Doronichev) ...to grow some cabbages.

1974
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,720
Have you seen Elon Musk?

1975
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,320
I sit pretty close to him.

1976
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,960
I see him every Tuesday.

1977
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,960
- He sits out with everyone?
- Yeah.

1978
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,640
Well, not exactly out.

1979
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:16,360
- There's the office floor, and then a small room,
it's open too.
- Yeah?

1980
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,640
And his open office
is in that room.

1981
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,880
And like all the local billionaires,

1982
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,560
he's super chill and works
next to everyone?

1983
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,800
Yep. Yep.

1984
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,720
He walks around.
He talks to people.

1985
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:31,480
I first met him in my first
week on the job.

1986
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,880
I didn't know if he was
around or whatever.

1987
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,720
I come out of the, excuse the details,
bathroom,

1988
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,080
staring at my phone, typing,
talking to someone.

1989
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:43,640
Someone walks past me
and goes: "Hey! Hi."

1990
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:48,400
That's a standard American greeting even
for people you don't necessarily know.

1991
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:52,040
I was already used to it.
I went, "Hi."

1992
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,800
Without even looking up. And I sensed something's
wrong because people started turning heads.

1993
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,840
People still turn their heads
when he walks past.

1994
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,000
I looked up. It was Elon.

1995
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,600
- A real live Musk?!
- Yep. The real deal.
(car beeps)

1996
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:09,040
(car buzzes three times)

1997
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,040
(muffled Wizards in Winter by Trans-Siberian
Orchestra starts playing)

1998
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,200
That's another mode.

1999
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,640
(music continues playing)

2000
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,720
What is it doing?

2001
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,920
That's the Christmas Mode.

2002
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,840
It's presenting itself or something?

2003
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,360
Something like that, yeah.

2004
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,200
- "Come here, driver."
- You could say that.

2005
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,760
- Woah!
- It's starting.
- Damn!

2006
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:35,200
(music gets louder and continues playing)

2007
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:44,640
(lights flash in sync with guitars and keyboards)

2008
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,880
(Dud') That's crazy!
Look, it's flapping its wings.

2009
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,760
- (Dud') I understand that it's like car striptease?
- Sort of.

2010
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,520
(Dud') It's like she's undressing so you...

2011
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:06,000
(Yeriomin) Yeah. For your visual pleasure.

2012
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,120
I'm not leaving my baby. I'm not!

2013
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,120
Despite this undressing act!

2014
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:15,680
(Yeriomin) So tempting.

2015
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,560
She's tempting you
with those open doors.

2016
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:25,240
(music reaches crescendo and ends)

2017
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,880
Holy shit!

2018
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:32,040
(title card music)

2019
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,840
(Davidov) Over there is Cupertino, which you probably
know by the "designed in California" guys.

2020
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,960
- (Dud') That's the site of Apple's presentations.
- Yeah.

2021
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,680
Behind Cupertino is Milpitas
and other small villages.

2022
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,480
That way's Mountain View,
home of Google.

2023
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:50,320
Those two large hangars are where
NASA used to build blimps.

2024
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,720
Google's leasing them now.

2025
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:56,360
They leased that place for 50 years
because it has an airfield for jets.

2026
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,600
[Moffett Federal Airfield]
'Cause Google's execs
fly on private jets.

2027
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,760
[Moffett Federal Airfield]
And not just Google's execs.

2028
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,640
And not just Google's execs.

2029
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:04,160
Also at this Moffett Airfield,
the place with the hangars,

2030
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,520
Yuriy Milner hosts his own Nobel Prize
called the Breakthrough Awards.

2031
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:09,080
[Yuriy Milner is the founder of DST Global investment group.]
[Some of his investees include VK, Facebook, Twitter,]
[Alibaba Group, Xiaomi, Spotify, Airbnb and others]
Yuriy Milner hosts his own Nobel Prize
called the Breakthrough Awards.

2032
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,080
[Yuriy Milner is the founder of DST Global investment group.]
[Some of his investees include VK, Facebook, Twitter,]
[Alibaba Group, Xiaomi, Spotify, Airbnb and others]
He organized his own Nobel Prize.

2033
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:12,680
[Yuriy Milner is the founder of DST Global investment group.]
[Some of his investees include VK, Facebook, Twitter,]
[Alibaba Group, Xiaomi, Spotify, Airbnb and others]
He figured the Nobel Prize sucked
because it's awarded to old people

2034
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,760
He figured the Nobel Prize sucked
because it's awarded to old people

2035
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:19,280
for things they did ages ago, and it's all outdated,
and the discipline list is outdated.

2036
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,720
And the prize is too small.

2037
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,080
Let's award more money for pioneering
achievements here and now.

Hosts include Zuckerberg,
Milner himself, Musk.

2041
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:33,040
Hosts include Zuckerberg,
Milner himself, Musk.

2042
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,640
What's your take on Yuriy Milner?

2043
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,440
I think we should be proud
of Yuriy Milner.

2044
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,920
He's a true...

2045
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,480
He's probably the only Russian name
in the Valley's investment circles

2046
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:49,360
that's precisely on the same level
as all the other local

2047
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:53,920
Silicon Valley VCs,
venture capitalists.

2048
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,960
The deals he's made and the outcomes
of those deals,

2049
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,600
including investing in VK,

2050
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,960
they're brilliant,
well thought-out moves

2051
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,200
that, from the top of my head, none of the other
Russian investors have made.

2052
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:14,680
Same with Facebook, in which
he invested very early on.

2053
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:19,520
Milner is like an apostle
of venture capital.

2054
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:25,200
Milner is great in that he's
the first Russian investor

2055
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:28,720
who made a fortune
using venture capital

2056
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:35,040
and proved to the world that Russia
has both money and the brains

2057
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,880
to manage this money wisely,

2058
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:42,040
and also entrepreneurs
to capitalize on.

2059
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,120
But the bulk of his investments
weren't in Russian business?

2060
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,520
Later on, no, but he started
with Russian business.

2061
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,600
His main asset was Mail.Ru,

2062
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,800
which he basically collected piece
by piece and took it public.

2063
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:58,000
Later on, when they were going public,
he invested in Facebook,

2064
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:03,480
he invested in Twitter, he invested
in Groupon, Zynga...

2065
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:09,200
The list of companies he and his fund DST
have invested in goes on and on.

2066
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:13,640
He's probably one of two or three
people in the Valley

2067
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:16,520
responsible for the idea
of the unicorn race.

2068
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,440
A unicorn is a company that costs one billion
dollars, yep, and is still privately owned.

2069
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,280
It hasn't gone public.

2070
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,920
The reasoning used to be:
"I'll create a company. Let it grow."

2071
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,720
"Once it's worth $1 billion, I'll go to the stock market.
From then on, we'll be a public company."

2072
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:35,040
"We'll issue new shares. Investors at
the stock market will buy them."

2073
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,200
"That's how we grow. We'll know
exactly how much we're worth."

2074
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:38,840
Milner said: "Uh-uh."

2075
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:42,200
"We can raise enough money

2076
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:46,680
"to go public when the company's worth
$100 billion rather than $1 billion."

2077
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:50,440
In the movie Social Network, Sean Parker
tells the young Zuckerberg:

2078
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,680
"A million dollars isn't cool.
A billion dollars is."

2079
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:56,880
Then Milner comes along and says:
"Dude, a billion dollars isn't cool.
A hundred billions are."

2080
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,120
Milner is in the movie?

2081
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:01,040
No, he isn't. But he would've
been in the sequel.

2082
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,400
Because Milner came to Facebook

2083
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,200
and didn't just beat
all other offers.

2084
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,120
Everyone here was doing
the cuckoo sign at first:

2085
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:12,560
some crazy Russian showed up and bought
the most expensive house in the Valley.

2086
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,640
Something like $120 or $140 million.

2087
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,160
[According to Wall Street Journal, in 2011, Milner bought]
[a house in the Silicon Valley for $100 million]
OUCH! (coughs)

2088
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,720
[According to Wall Street Journal, in 2011, Milner bought]
[a house in the Silicon Valley for $100 million]
The most expensive house
ever sold in the Valley.

2089
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,160
[According to Wall Street Journal, in 2011, Milner bought]
[a house in the Silicon Valley for $100 million]
- Fence?
- No. No fence.

2090
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:21,720
- Fence?
- No. No fence.

2091
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,120
Well, a chain-link one.

2092
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:28,360
Then he comes to Facebook who are unable
to raise more money than in the previous round.

2093
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,400
I believe they'd gotten $6 billion.
Now, they were being offered $4 billion.

2094
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:35,680
Milner shows up and says:
"Guys, I'll give you ten."

2095
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:40,000
"I can also tell you're having
trouble raising money."

2096
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:43,520
"I'll be your agent. I'll help you raise
money in all future rounds."

2097
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,040
As an adviser?

2098
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:48,760
Yeah. He lead them all the way
to IPO on NASDAQ,

2099
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,760
where they were worth $70 billion,
I believe, at the time of offering.

2100
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,080
Today, they're worth $400 to $500
depending on stock price.

2101
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:57,320
How much did he multiply
his investment?

2102
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,560
Uh... Seven times. At least.

2103
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,600
In the process, he made money
off of WhatsApp.

2104
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,280
'Cause Facebook bought WhatsApp with
a substantial amount of their shares.

2105
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,440
[Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.]
[A substantial portion of this sum was paid]
[with Facebook shares]
'Cause Facebook bought WhatsApp with
a substantial amount of their shares.

2106
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,920
[Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.]
[A substantial portion of this sum was paid]
[with Facebook shares]
Milner was an early investor
of WhatsApp too.

2107
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,560
Do you think it's a team?

2108
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,600
I mean, he manages a fund where a team
of people predicts where to invest.

2109
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:18,920
He has intuition and great
understanding of the market.

2110
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,360
'Cause the most important thing here today
is predicting what's gonna happen tomorrow.

2111
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:26,120
Today, AI and biomedicine are king.

2112
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:30,320
Virtual reality, which was popular three
years ago, has fallen off considerably.

2113
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,120
It's not as hot anymore.

2114
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:39,080
But biomedicine and development
of AIs for soil irrigation are super in.

2115
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,240
What's biomedicine?

2116
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,320
Biomedicine means biohacking.

2117
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,320
The things

2118
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,720
that help you live longer and enjoy
your health and life itself for longer.

2119
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,000
Like erection at 80?

2120
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,160
Exactly. This project will surely get
billions in investment money.

2121
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,240
He has a great team. He has
the best team in the world.

2122
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,520
And they're not Russian?

2123
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,520
It's a mix. Some are Russian,
some aren't.

2124
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,200
Why is he so reclusive?

2125
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:07,640
- His wife gave an interview to the
Science and Life magazine.
- And Tatler.

2126
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:12,000
I understand his wife is a big-time
local socialite.

2127
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:14,360
They live an incredibly
complicated life.

2128
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:20,520
They probably put together more parties
than anyone in the Valley.

2129
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:26,240
His annual Gagarin Party, which just
happens to share its name with our fund,

2130
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:30,800
gathers all the local big shots
in large quantities.

2131
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,560
Every morning, somebody has breakfast at his place.
Every night, someone has dinner at his place.

2132
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,160
Every week, a party
for around 30 people.

2133
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,960
When he's in the Valley,
the house is never empty.

2134
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,640
And it's complicated event management.
It's continuous event management.

2135
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:47,360
- What for? For fun or for business?
- For business.

2136
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:52,960
Milner says that venture capitalism lives
and dies by asymmetry of information.

2137
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,960
One investor has a little information.
Another has a little more.

2138
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,200
The investor with the most information
ultimately profits off of everyone else.

2139
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,600
That's why, to possess more
information than anyone,

2140
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,560
you need to maintain social
connections, the network,

2141
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,240
with all the important people.

2142
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,040
(title card music)

2143
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,640
(Dud') Regarding the fact that everyone here
is either a startupper or an investor.

2144
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:23,200
Dude in Moscow saves up
half a million dollars,

2145
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:26,400
they're thinking of getting
a place in downtown.

2146
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,920
He'd think differently here,
wouldn't he?

2147
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,200
Down here, he'd think: "Why would
I buy something for half a mil?"

2148
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:36,680
- "I'd rather found my own fund and start
giving out small..."
- Not even a fund!

2149
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:40,560
Not even a fund.
They'd go to a meet-up

2150
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,080
where startuppers present
their projects...

2151
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:46,200
- A meet-up?
- Small gathering.
- There's several a day, right?

2152
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,560
There's like 50.

2153
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:52,880
If you open Events Near Me on Facebook,
it'll take ages to scroll through them all.

2154
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,160
What is it like?
Guys just gather and..?

2155
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,440
Yeah. Someone's found a place
where you can sit people down.

2156
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,080
Someone has a friend
at Silicon Valley Bank,

2157
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:06,760
they tell 'em, "We're doing a biotech
startup meet-up."

2158
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,480
They go: "Hey, that's cool. We wanna
pitch in. We'll pay for the wine."

2159
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,960
You have a little standing buffet,
a stage, a screen and projector setup.

2160
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,120
They get guests from Google,
Facebook, engineers.

2161
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:20,920
They're listening, going:
"I think this will take off."

2162
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,400
"I wanna invest $10,000 in you."

2163
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,160
That's how people raise their
first hundred thousand.

2164
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,720
How does our fund work?

2165
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:33,320
There's always a hierarchy, right? We know
that when we invest in 30 companies...

2166
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,000
A little into each.

2167
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,000
How much is "a little?"

2168
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,400
- $200 to $400 thousand.
- Uh-huh.

2169
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:44,080
This is after they've gotten
the initial, angel funding.

2170
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,720
They have a product, some numbers.
Sometimes even revenue.

2171
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:53,320
Out of those thirty,
ten will be doing very well.

2172
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:59,000
Out of those ten, we'll pick five,
maybe seven, strongest ones,

2173
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,120
and give them a million,
a million and a half more.

2174
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,360
Out of them, one will be
doing super well,

2175
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,880
and give a 3x return
on the fund's investment,

2176
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:09,880
with another 3x return from the rest
of the companies combined.

2177
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:15,680
I.e., to make a profit, you need to make at least
30 deals if you know what you're doing

2178
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,440
or 100 deals if you don't know
what you're doing.

2179
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:20,720
You said thirty. How many
of them will fail?

2180
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,560
- Most of them.
- Most of them.

2181
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,520
- But others will make enough
to make up for it?
- Yes.

2182
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,880
And make a profit.

2183
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:31,080
Percentage of failures in
the Valley is very high.

2184
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:35,560
A lot more startups fail
than take off.

2185
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:41,000
Interestingly, the percentage of failed startups
today is likely much greater than 15 years ago.

2186
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,480
When I travel...

2187
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:49,360
My major is venture capital, the Valley,
innovative ecosystems, corporate innovations.

2188
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:54,000
I travel a lot and I keep hearing:
"A lot more startups fail today in the Valley."

2189
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:58,840
"Does that mean the Valley is losing
something, its secret sauce?"

2190
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,520
Quite the opposite.

2191
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:04,840
Because the business model
of startup financing

2192
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,280
and the process of startup creation
have changed drastically.

2193
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:12,640
If you have $50,000, 15 years ago,
you couldn't do anything with them.

2194
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:15,480
Today, you can open a new startup
with this money.

2195
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,040
All the startups that came
out of our studio

2196
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,720
and all the new up-and-coming
startups making waves,

2197
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,200
with rare exceptions, they don't need
to raise $5 million.

2198
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,440
They can take off by raising $250 or $500
thousand, maybe a million.

2199
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:32,560
Only when they're successful,
they'll then raise big money.

2200
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:36,280
This means that if you had
a crazy idea 15 years ago,

2201
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,120
but had no money,

2202
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:43,520
you needed a crazy person sharing your
vision with $5 million in the bank.

2203
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:47,920
Today, you need the same kind of crazy
person, only with $250,000 in the bank.

2204
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,240
Those are much more common.

2205
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:54,000
The most idiotic idea for an app
or startup in your memory?
(Doronichev laughs)

2206
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:57,280
- Or the most weird and wacky?
- Hmm...

2207
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:01,400
Like the app from the Silicon Valley
show that looked for...

2208
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,560
Like the Bro app.

2209
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,920
I believe you can't go wrong
with the Yo app here.

2210
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:12,840
At some point... I feel this was
the quintessence of this rush

2211
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,120
when people put money into
just about any mobile app.

2212
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:21,760
Some guy made an app with only one function —
to send someone else a "Yo."

2213
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,440
You type anything else.

2214
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,080
And they had a whole...

2215
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:29,040
People talked with straight faces that this
was the future of social communication,

2216
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:31,880
that "Yo" could be used to express
many different feelings.

2217
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,120
And... Yeah.

2218
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:37,960
They successfully raised money.
They raised several million to develop Yo.

2219
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,000
Didn't quite take off.

2220
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:43,400
They teach the idea of investing
ever since you're a child here.

2221
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:48,480
My kid's eight. I explained investing to him,
and now he invests money.

2222
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,240
He has a portfolio that he funds
with the allowance money

2223
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,360
that he's been saving up
for two years now.

2224
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,880
He's investing this money in the four
companies he believes in.

2225
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,160
He's investing in Google, Netflix,
Microsoft and Amazon.

2226
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,400
Hold up! Virtually or for real?

2227
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,040
No, I bought pieces of
those companies for him.

2228
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,280
- Real Google shares?
- Yes.

2229
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:13,520
He now follows his portfolio
and he understands

2230
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:18,840
that money is not something
you hoard in a golden safe

2231
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:21,760
and then spend on pretty things,

2232
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,960
but rather that money is a tool.

2233
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,960
It's a tool that has to work.

2234
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,920
It's like your employee. You find them a job
and they do something useful.

2235
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,200
Somewhere else, while you don't
actively use them.

2236
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:39,840
All Americans understand this key idea
since they're little. It's very important.

2237
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,080
When you understand this, you also
understand the idea of diversification,

2238
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:49,000
i.e. that if you put all your "soldiers,"
your money in one place

2239
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,880
without spreading them out
and lowering risks,

2240
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,240
then you'll probably...
It's super risky.

2241
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:59,000
You're likely to either make
very little or lose it all.

2242
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,920
You don't get investment rounds
for sitting on your ass.

2243
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:05,440
At some point, you have to
show a profit.

2244
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:08,040
And this profit has to be
a multiple of...

2245
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:13,760
Your profit combined with speed of your
growth determine your valuation.

2246
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:19,800
You may bum your initial money
off people on the idea stage.

2247
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:25,520
You can raise $500,000, a million, two million in
investment money with just your idea and your name.

2248
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:30,200
"My name is Yuriy Dud'.
I'm super successful on YouTube."

2249
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:35,280
"I have this idea for a platform to promote
up-and-coming YouTube faces."

2250
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:39,680
"Here are some designs and ideas.
Please, give me funding to get started."

2251
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:40,760
At that stage, yeah.

2252
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,320
How much do you think
we could get?

2253
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:47,560
I think you could raise two
million on the seed stage.

2254
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:49,920
- Dollars?
- Yeah.
- What do I do with them?

2255
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:53,800
Depends on your business idea,
but you'll probably hire engineers.

2256
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:59,160
If you're smart about it, you'll hire engineers
in Russia or Belarus or something.

2257
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,880
'Cause it's gonna be much cheaper

2258
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,920
and you'll be able to hire some super talented
guys that you wouldn't be able to afford here.

2259
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:08,520
With that money,
you'll build your MVP,

2260
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,560
the initial version of your product.

2261
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:11,520
My what?

2262
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,280
MVP, minimum viable product.

2263
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:15,960
In my world, that stands for
"most valuable player."

2264
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,360
(Doronichev laughs)
- (Dud') That's why I got confused.
- Gotcha!

2265
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,920
You'll build the initial version
of your product

2266
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:27,760
that will prove to the investors and you that
you have a so-called product-market fit,

2267
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:33,160
i.e. that your product does indeed
satisfy an existing demand.

2268
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:37,920
Once you see that people are returning
and the product's growing,

2269
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:40,880
you'll go and get the next round,
this time, for expansion.

2270
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,720
You'll get your Round A,

2271
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:49,000
[Round A is the second or third round of capital raising.]
[It starts when the firm enters the market, begins]
[serial production and hires a full team]
which you'll spend on growing your product as
quickly as possible without getting sidetracked

2272
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,080
[Round A is the second or third round of capital raising.]
[It starts when the firm enters the market, begins]
[serial production and hires a full team]
to millions and billions
of users.

2273
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:57,040
In Russia, where the entrepreneurship culture is
far less evolved than here, there's a stereotype:

2274
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:04,040
young startuppers raise capital, then quickly
spend it on huge offices and expensive cars —

2275
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:08,200
all the self-gratifying things that have
nothing to do with the business.

2276
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,160
Does this ever happen here?

2277
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,360
Well, anything's possible.

2278
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:15,880
With tens of thousands of startups,
anything's possible.

2279
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,680
I'd say that local investors are
much more professional.

2280
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:24,880
Because funding startups, investors
are funding specific entrepreneurs.

2281
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:29,440
They always keep their
finger on the pulse.

2282
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:31,680
They also know what to expect.

2283
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:35,360
Particularly, when startuppers
don't exactly act right,

2284
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:40,680
smart investors immediately know what to look at,
how to assist and what to prevent.

2285
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,280
That's why situations like what you
described are possible,

2286
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:47,360
but they're extremely rare.

2287
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:49,320
Because here...

2288
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,640
If we look at the most
successful startups,

2289
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:57,080
what they spend on private jets after they've
become multi-billion companies is irrelevant,

2290
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,600
because starting out,

2291
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:03,560
they normally rent the cheapest office
or even manage without one these days,

2292
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,320
they save on everything,

2293
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,680
and certainly don't buy
expensive cars.

2294
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:11,400
- The idea can come from someone who's
not a programmer, right?
- Of course.

2295
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:16,320
The idea comes from someone
with a vision for a product.

2296
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:22,040
In your head, you're like: "I'm reaching
this audience and solving this problem."

2297
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,280
That's what product managers do,

2298
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:27,680
or in the case of a startup,
that's usually the founder.

2299
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,680
Not all founders are programmers?

2300
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,160
A lot of them aren't.

2301
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:38,400
The most common setup for a typical
tech company is two founders,

2302
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:40,640
this is very common,

2303
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:43,640
one's with a product/business vision,

2304
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:48,160
i.e. a people person and a problem
person who arranges things,

2305
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:50,560
the other's a tech guy.

2306
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:55,640
It's a common synergy that has
proven its effectiveness.

2307
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,840
Like Richard and Erlich
from Silicon Valley?

2308
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,640
Yeah, sort of.

2309
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,000
At 23, you signed a deal that
made you a millionaire.

At 23, you signed a deal that
made you a millionaire.

01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:06,800
[YEVGENIY NEVGEN]
[28 years old]
[Co-founder of the selfie mask app MSQRD]
Correct.

01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,160
[YEVGENIY NEVGEN]
[28 years old]
[Co-founder of the selfie mask app MSQRD]
Can you briefly tell us about it?

2313
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,080
About the deal itself?

2314
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:14,920
About how you created
the app MSQRD,

2315
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,200
which took off so well that it got
purchased by Facebook.

2316
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:21,120
Well, I didn't create it myself.
We had a pretty big team.

2317
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,280
In short, I started coding at 14.

2318
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,280
I always dreamt of creating startups.

2319
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:29,560
I read about it on the internet,
in magazines.

2320
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,840
I founded several companies.

2321
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:36,400
My childhood friend Sergey Gonchar
happened to move here.

2322
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:39,600
Together, we founded several
companies.

2323
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:43,240
Eventually, we designed
the mobile app MSQRD,

2324
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,720
which quickly became
rather popular.

2325
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:51,000
At some point, it appeared on the radar of
several major players, including Facebook.

2326
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:57,280
We did a lot of thinking and decided this was
the right move at this stage in our careers

2327
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:59,840
and agreed to sell
the company to Facebook.

2328
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:04,480
This was December 25, 2015.

2329
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:08,120
I was browsing App Store.

2330
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:15,760
I regularly download App Store's top 200 or top 500,
whatever's new, always on the lookout for new stuff.

2331
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:21,560
And I read in some local
Belarusian news

2332
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:25,640
that they'd held a hackathon
with such and such new projects.

2333
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,760
I read about it and was like:
"Cool idea!"

2334
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:31,200
It said they'd promised to release
the app by Catholic Christmas.

2335
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:34,640
I'm like: "Hey, it's the 25th. Let's see
if they kept their promise."

2336
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,760
They had. It just released.

2337
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,440
I clicked on it.

2338
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,920
I open it and go: "This is nice.
This will take off."

2339
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,240
"This will definitely take off. I even know
how I'm gonna promote it."

2340
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,920
I check out the publisher.
It's an Indian name.

2341
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,360
"Yauheni Neuhen."

2342
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:54,200
When you transliterate Belarusian names
into English, they always look funny.

2343
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:56,680
It actually was Yavgeniy Nevgen,
you know?

2344
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,200
"Yauheni Neuhen."

2345
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:01,800
I thought it was Indian, and was like:
"Wait, I read about Belarusians!"

2346
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,080
I find him on Facebook and
start typing a message,

2347
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:07,400
and it loads the history, showing that he's been
trying to reach me for 18 months,

2348
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,360
but Facebook's been filtering it out,
so I never knew.

2349
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,560
I got so embarrassed.

2350
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:14,800
We agreed to meet. I talked
to him and Yura Gurskiy,

2351
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:17,800
[Yuriy Gurskiy is a Belarusian IT entrepreneur.]
[Was a mentor and investor of projects]
[like Flo, Prisma, MSQRD,Maps.Me]
whom he already knew —
Gurskiy was the project's mentor.

2352
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,760
[Yuriy Gurskiy is a Belarusian IT entrepreneur.]
[Was a mentor and investor of projects]
[like Flo, Prisma, MSQRD,Maps.Me]
They said: "We don't need money at the moment.
Nothing to spend on just yet."

2353
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,320
[Yuriy Gurskiy is a Belarusian IT entrepreneur.]
[Was a mentor and investor of projects]
[like Flo, Prisma, MSQRD,Maps.Me]
"But we could use help in the States."

2354
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:26,280
"You're in the States.
Help us get big in the States."

2355
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,760
"We have 500 users.
We wanna get big."

2356
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,480
- I started...
- 500?
- 500 users total.

2357
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,520
I was user #515.

2358
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:37,440
It was basically all friends of Zhenia,
Seriozha and another Zhenia.

2359
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:42,520
[*Second most popular local social network in Russia.]
[Mostly used by the older generation.]
Can you explain what MSQRD is to people
who still use Odnoklassniki*?

2360
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:49,480
They're masks that appeared on people's faces
when they made selfies or shot videos?

2361
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,760
Instagram introduced these masks
after they bought you?

2362
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:58,280
Yes, on Instagram and in other
Facebook products,

2363
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:01,760
like Messenger and
the Facebook app itself,

2364
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:05,560
it's our technology, our platform
and our masks.

2365
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,280
So Facebook didn't just buy your app?
They bought your solution

2366
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,680
and started integrating it
into their products?

2367
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:16,200
Yeah, the idea was to buy
the team

2368
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:20,920
that created the solution
and all the artwork

2369
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,720
and the solution itself.

2370
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,720
They didn't much care
about the app itself.

2371
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:30,800
They wanted to introduce this feature
in other Facebook products.

2372
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,440
Let me get this straight. When a company
like Facebook buys an app,

2373
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:39,280
they're not buying an App Store icon —
they're buying the solution?

2374
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:44,240
Of course. In most cases,
pretty much always,

2375
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:48,040
Facebook has little interest
in the product's users,

2376
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,920
because Facebook has...

2377
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:52,960
- Enough of its own.
- ...several billion users. Billions!

2378
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,920
Few can match that number.

2379
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:00,000
That's why they buy solutions and
the people behind those solutions.

2380
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:03,200
- This was in March of 2016?
- Yes.

2381
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,760
Were Instagram stories
around at the time?

2382
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:11,800
That's was Facebook's plan — to launch
stories with masks as a day one feature.

2383
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,520
- So they launched after?
- Yes.

2384
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,080
I understand that one of the reasons
stories took off so well

2385
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:19,240
was the abundance of strapped on
extras, including masks?

2386
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,920
...Of various artistic tools, yeah.

2387
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,640
Draw something, put on a mask.

2388
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,800
Now I understand the idea
behind the deal.

2389
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,520
I get why they did it, 'cause when
you buy an app with —

2390
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,920
how many users did you have,
ten million?

2391
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,040
Thirty.

2392
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,120
Thirty at the time.

2393
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:37,600
Okay. Whatever.
...What do you do with them?

2394
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:39,080
Why buy you?

2395
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:44,040
Why not hire one of you and have
them explain how it works?

2396
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:48,480
Well, for starters, the technology
itself wasn't unique.

2397
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:52,240
There were even similar open-source
solutions available online.

2398
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:56,320
The base technology
is called Face Tracking.

2399
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:01,400
Those technologies were available — you could
download it from github or something.

2400
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,720
Our technology, developed by
MSQRD's co-founder

2401
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:06,920
Zhenia Zatepiakin,

2402
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,840
he's the creator of this technology,

2403
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:12,920
it was the fastest solution
for mobile phones.

2404
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,880
As you know, mobile phones have certain
limitations in terms of performance.

2405
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:22,360
Zhenia Zatepiakin's scientific
work aimed to develop

2406
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:27,160
an algorithm that would be as precise and
as fast as possible on mobile phones.

2407
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:30,160
We did a cool stunt with
Jimmy Kimmel.

2408
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:33,160
- That was you?
- Yeah.
- He didn't notice you first?

2409
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:39,720
His director followed Zhenia Zatepiakin,
one of the co-founders, on Twitter.

2410
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,160
Zhenia told me.

2411
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,920
I went and checked it out,

2412
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,800
and sent him a direct message,

2413
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:47,560
saying: "Hey! Heard you liked
MSQRD?"

2414
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:50,880
He said: "Yeah,Jimmy's daughter
and I love it."

2415
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:52,920
"Cool app. Guys did well."

2416
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,520
I'm like: "Can I call you?"

2417
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:56,000
We talked.

2418
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:58,120
I did my homework —

2419
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:02,560
I watched like 20 episodes of Kimmel Live,
found out he didn't like Matt Damon.

2420
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,000
His girlfriend had left him
for Matt Damon.

2421
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,320
And every episode, he says:

2422
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,200
"We have..."

2423
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:12,680
For those who don't know,
Kimmel Live is Evening Urgant.

2424
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:16,880
- One of Evening Urgants.
- Yeah, there's lots of them here.
They're all alike.

2425
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,280
And he's been making fun of
Matt Damon for years?

2426
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:23,080
"We'll have Matt Damon on." Followed by:
"My apologies to Matt Damon. We ran out of time."

2427
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:27,840
I went: "Jimmy, how about
we make a mask of you?"

2428
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:31,120
He says: "Can you make one
of Guillermo?" He's like our...

2429
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:33,640
- Hrustaliov?
- Hrustaliov. That's their Guillermo.

2430
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,920
I went: "No problem. We'll throw in
a Matt Damon mask."

2431
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,840
"For you to try on."

2432
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:40,960
He laughed.

2433
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,320
We couldn't make it in time
before he needed to go on air.

2434
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:48,360
And he just said: "You know what? Screw it.
You have a great app. I'll show it off as is."

2435
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:54,000
He showed us once. They fooled
around with it and laughed.

2436
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:56,520
It aired. People noticed the app.

2437
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:00,000
We later finished the mask,
sent it to him and said:

2438
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:04,240
"Jimmy, here's your mask. Here's Guillermo's.
No Matt though — we ran out of time."

2439
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:08,160
He laughed for five minutes
non-stop on the phone.

2440
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:10,280
He said: "Well, now I just have to
feature you again."

2441
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:13,000
And gave us like five minutes
of screen time.

2442
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,640
Five days later, you closed
the Facebook deal?

2443
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:18,960
Not closed yet.
It was in the process.

2444
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,800
- The deal took four days to close?
- It was all done very fast.

2445
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:28,560
It coincided with the weekend, and we
had to pay the lawyers double.

2446
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:31,920
For some reason, Facebook wanted
to do it as quickly as possible.

2447
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:36,200
Probably to avoid this information
from spreading to other corporations

2448
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:39,240
who could contact us with
a better counter-offer.

2449
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:42,920
They didn't want any
setbacks or leaks.

2450
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:45,320
So they wanted to close the deal
as quickly as possible.

2451
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:49,200
You mean you had to stay in the office
round the clock, at night too,

2452
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,960
while the lawyers were handling
the paperwork?

2453
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,440
Or you weren't there physically?

2454
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:55,880
They didn't spend four days STRAIGHT
doing the paperwork.

2455
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,400
We didn't spend four days
in the office with the lawyers.

2456
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:01,760
It involved different people:

2457
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:06,440
Belarusian lawyers, Facebook lawyers,
our American lawyers.

2458
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:10,080
It was a lot of work, and it was
done in two shifts:

2459
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,640
Belarusian office and American office.

2460
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,880
How is your work evaluated
in these situations?

2461
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:17,920
Through discussion.
Depends on your role.

2462
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:21,520
If you're a strategic advisor that does
the M&A, then it's 4%, 5% or 6%.

2463
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:23,360
[M&A stands for "mergers and acquisitions," i.e. a deal]
[that merges two or more companies into on.]
If you're a strategic advisor that does
M&A, then it's 4%, 5% or 6%.

2464
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:27,120
[M&A stands for "mergers and acquisitions," i.e. a deal]
[that merges two or more companies into on.]
If you simply introduced them and they signed
the deal themselves, you get 1%.

2465
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:29,200
If you simply introduced them and they signed
the deal themselves, you get 1%.

2466
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:33,600
Zhenia Nevgen became
a multimillionaire after this deal?

2467
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:37,120
Zhenia Nevgen is a very talented
and successful young man.

2468
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,600
Can't confirm any numbers.

2469
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:42,240
Millions of bucks at 23.
Is that a burden?

2470
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:47,560
They asked me about a month after
the deal at some conference in Minsk

2471
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,360
what was different
in my new life.

2472
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:52,720
I said, "Now, I take the taxi."

2473
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:55,880
'Cause before that,
we used to ride the bus.

2474
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,120
That's how the first
few years went.

2475
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:04,080
The money we were getting...

2476
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:07,200
Importantly, we didn't get the entire
sum all at once.

2477
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:12,080
There wasn't a moment where all the money
for the deal instantly appeared in our account.

2478
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:16,240
They paid gradually, and it
actually took a while.

2479
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:19,600
Also, we tried to invest the money
as soon as we got it.

2480
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:23,880
We didn't start spending on
expensive things or something.

2481
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:31,320
We only got the things we desperately
needed as soon as we got the money,

2482
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:36,560
but there was never a moment where
our world view suddenly changed.

2483
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:40,520
(title card music)

2484
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,080
What is that?

2485
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:48,240
That's our new app, currently being developed
by the ex-MSQRD team. It's called Loóna.

2486
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,880
Like the Russian rock band.

2487
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,280
It helps people fall asleep...
or get in the mood to sleep —

2488
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:56,400
relax after work,
forget about the...

2489
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:59,800
A lot of people flick through
Instagram and watch YouTube

2490
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:04,560
because they can't just get into their
bed and fall asleep after work.

2491
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:09,200
I know that a lot... I can tell you're one
of those people who instantly crash out.

2492
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:10,720
Yeah, totally.

2493
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:13,640
- But...
- You don't idle on Instagram before falling asleep?
- No.

2494
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:21,760
Well, in reality, a large number
of people can't fall asleep quickly.

2495
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:26,720
They keep thinking about
the events of the day,

2496
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:31,960
their issues and worries, their plans for
tomorrow, and they need a distraction.

2497
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,840
What do you do here?
You color?

2498
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:38,600
We have a number of scenes.
They're all particular places.

2499
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,480
- So it's mechanical in...
- What happens if you swipe?

2500
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,800
When you're done coloring the scene,
it puts on a sleep story.

2501
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,640
It's a story about the place
from the scene.

2502
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:53,520
The user shuts off the screen, puts the device
down on their night stand

2503
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:57,360
and listens to this story that
helps them doze off.

2504
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:59,520
- The story's in English?
- Yes, in English.

2505
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:02,520
So the Belarusians immediately
went global again.

2506
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,400
We'll probably add Russian
language too.

2507
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,920
What do you think about MSQRD?

2508
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:14,600
I'm astounded by how this project was
starting out and what it's become,

2509
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:19,600
and how this in a way led to the explosion
of the Belarusian wing of the industry.

2510
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:24,400
There's a ton of projects right now created by
MSQRD's co-founders or former employees.

2511
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:26,080
This is a success for the CIS
as a whole.

2512
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:28,080
'Cause now, when we
present ourselves,

2513
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:32,120
many know about the successes of
MSQRD, Prisma, Wargaming.

2514
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:36,440
This makes it much easier
to get funding.

2515
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:38,080
Reliable gang?

2516
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,680
Yeah! If those guy made it,
why can't these?

2517
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:45,240
Because there hadn't been too many cases
of successful company sales in the Valley.

2518
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:48,720
- (Dud') Your dog is from Belarus?
- Yes! From Minsk.

2519
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:51,880
It's a Swiss mountain dog,
but it hails from Belarus.

2520
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,160
- Was she a gift from your partners?
- No, I bought her myself.

2521
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:57,280
We wanted to get this
breed specifically,

2522
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,400
There were lines for them in Moscow.
The puppies are sold before they're conceived.

2523
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,440
It's crazy.

2524
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:07,760
"We're mating the dog and
the bitch in three months."

2525
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,480
"We'll probably have 4 or 5 puppies."

2526
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:10,960
"But we're selling them now."

2527
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,840
(Davidov laughs)
(Dud') Damn! Sounds like a startup!

2528
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:19,920
It's crazy. My aunt said: "I know a breeder, but she's
in Minsk. You'll have to drive for the doggie."

2529
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:23,600
We did. Went and got the dog
and came back.

2530
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:25,280
You're obsessed with Belarus,
aren't you?

2531
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:30,960
No! The dog was my first and least successful
Belarusian investment. All others were great.

2532
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,240
Legend, or maybe truth, has it

2533
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:37,920
that Masquerade Technologies was born
as a result a 48-hour hackathon.

2534
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,960
There's some truth to it, yeah.

2535
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:45,400
You came together... A hackathon is an event
where programmers develop all sorts of things.

2536
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:49,360
The reason I know this isn't because I'm smart.
Sports.ru just hosted a bunch of them.

2537
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,680
So I got to see it.

2538
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:56,000
That's where you first showed
your whole thing with masks.

2539
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:02,880
I read that one of the masks you showed
off was a mask with mustache.
(Nevgen laughs)

2540
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:05,480
It belonged to Aleksandr Lukashenko.
Is that true?

2541
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,440
It's true. But this mask was never
available to the public.

2542
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:12,440
Funny story, actually.

2543
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:16,400
When we came to the hackathon,
we had some things prepped.

2544
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:19,360
Most importantly, we had
the face tracking technology,

2545
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:22,440
but we didn't have everything
ready for the app.

2546
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:25,720
Well, hackathon rules state you
shouldn't have ANYTHING ready.

2547
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:26,640
Yeah.

2548
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:32,160
Of course, we did the majority of
development at the hackathon.

2549
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:36,760
We realized we couldn't put in all
the masks that we wanted in time.

2550
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:41,880
We decided to use some of the
most recognizable faces.

2551
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,000
Well, who's the most famous,
most recognizable Belarusian?

2552
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:48,560
So yeah, at the hackathon,
we had this mask.

2553
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:51,760
But we knew that...

2554
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:57,240
...we couldn't go general public with it, so we got
rid of this mask after the hackathon.

2555
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:58,600
Why not?

2556
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:05,440
For starters, our criminal code prohibits
offending the president.

2557
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:08,080
That was a sufficient reason.

2558
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,200
Fellow countries.

2559
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:13,360
Nevgen's currently involved
with the startup Flo.

2560
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:15,080
Yeah. He's an investor.

2561
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:17,960
- It's a menstrual cycle app?
- Yeah. It's great!

2562
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,560
There's a huge number, like 80 million women
around the world use it to track their cycle.

2563
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:24,960
And it brings money?

2564
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,480
It does. There's a subscription fee.

2565
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:33,200
The cycle can slip. It's not synced
with the calendar.

2566
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:35,320
It depends on a bunch of factors.

2567
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,000
Knowing when your cycle's
coming up is very handy.

2568
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:45,520
With Flo, several hundred thousand women every
month plan to get pregnant and get pregnant.

2569
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:51,960
The fact itself that people now know what's going
on with them, their body and their health,

2570
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,960
that makes us happy.

2571
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,120
This is a calling for us.
It's a dream.

2572
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:00,120
Our bedtime app Loóna.

2573
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:05,560
Again, it helps people become more productive,
because they get a good night's sleep.

2574
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:09,680
We know we're having an impact.

2575
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:14,520
We're doing something
meaningful and valuable.

2576
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:16,280
That's very important to us.

2577
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,800
Who's developing it?

2578
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:24,280
Other Belarusians? Belarusians
in Gomel, in Grodno, in Vitebsk?

2579
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:26,960
Yes, it's made by Belarusian guys, but...

2580
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,600
It's getting harder and harder
to hire in Belarus.

2581
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:33,600
There's a lot of IT companies
in Belarus today.

2582
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:35,360
There's series competition
for quality staff.

2583
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:38,400
We hire people from
all over the world.

2584
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,880
We bring in people from
Ukraine and Russia.

2585
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:46,640
We meet them at the airport,
help them situate, sit them down.

2586
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:54,600
For this particular product, we're currently
running a pretty large HR campaign.

2587
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,960
Hiring...

2588
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:02,360
You're looking for... Hold on. You're telling me
that Belarusian engineers are so loaded

2589
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,760
that you have to hire
in Russia and Ukraine?

2590
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:10,800
- They're in such high demand that you have to
bring in people from other countries?
- It would appear so.

2591
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:13,160
(Nevgen laughs)

2592
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,040
You can certainly say that software
engineer is a very popular job in Belarus.

2593
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,400
Why are there so many of you?

2594
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,320
- Software engineers?
- Yeah! Belarus is like a motherlode.

2595
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:26,920
These guys created Wargaming.
These ones made Masquerade.

2596
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:29,520
And you just keep going.
Why?

2597
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,400
Lots of smart people.

2598
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:35,080
No oil. Maybe that's why.

2599
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:36,320
No oil?

2600
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,080
Well, there's a little.
But barely.

2601
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:40,520
What a reason!

2602
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:43,120
- I think there's a link.
- Why?

2603
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:49,520
The link is that when you have a small
country with a small domestic market,

2604
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,320
you have to produce things

2605
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:57,720
for the entire planet Earth.

2606
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:03,640
Maybe that's also the reason why Israel
is such a big IT country. Estonia too.

2607
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:05,680
Small country. No domestic demand.

2608
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:11,200
You have no choice but to come up
with something to make money.

2609
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:12,920
They don't have domestic demand.

2610
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:16,840
Meaning, they can't sell
anything back in Belarus.

2611
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:18,480
They don't have the money
in Belarus to buy it.

2612
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:22,040
Say, a Russian entrepreneur starts
developing an innovative product.

2613
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:26,720
Who are they creating it for? For Gazprom,
or MTS, or Sberbank, or any other local...

2614
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:29,480
- Or the Russian market in general.
- Exactly.

2615
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:32,160
They start making money off of it,

2616
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,280
and they can no longer go foreign.

2617
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:36,400
- Why?
- Because business is different
everywhere.

2618
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:39,160
All companies have their own mentalities.
You need different products...

2619
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,600
- And Belarusians?
- Belarusians don't have any local buyers!

2620
02:16:41,639 --> 02:16:44,159
They aim for the American or the global
market from the start.

2621
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:47,640
Two countries are like that:
Belarus and Israel.

2622
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:50,800
Also, their government
is pretty chill about it.

2623
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:51,440
Funny, isn't it? The head of
the Technopark came here.

2624
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:54,840
[In December of 2017, Belarus passed a law concerning IT.]
[It made cryptocurrencies and the blockchain legal,]
[established English law institutes and visa-free entry]
[for international employees of the local IT cluster]
Funny, isn't it? The head of
the Technopark came here.

2625
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:59,239
[In December of 2017, Belarus passed a law concerning IT.]
[It made cryptocurrencies and the blockchain legal,]
[established English law institutes and visa-free entry]
[for international employees of the local IT cluster]
- Right?
- He's a state official back in Belarus.

2626
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:01,920
[In December of 2017, Belarus passed a law concerning IT.]
[It made cryptocurrencies and the blockchain legal,]
[established English law institutes and visa-free entry]
[for international employees of the local IT cluster]
They told me: "Kolia, meet with him.
He's a cool dude."

2627
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:02,399
[In December of 2017, Belarus passed a law concerning IT.]
[It made cryptocurrencies and the blockchain legal,]
[established English law institutes and visa-free entry]
[for international employees of the local IT cluster]
Wait, what's a technopark?

2628
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:03,400
Wait, what's a technopark?

2629
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:08,240
[*High-tech business area in Moscow.]
- They have this place in Minsk...
- It's like a Minsk Skolkovo*?
- It's a Skolkovo made right.

2630
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:09,280
Right?

2631
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:14,160
As I talk to him, I realize that
they have the right idea.

2632
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:21,480
For example, he said: "If a Belarusian is moving
to the Silicon Valley to found a startup

2633
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:23,440
"or to work at Google,

2634
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:26,120
"I'll help them every way I can."

2635
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,560
"I'll go to their place and
pack their things."

2636
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,840
"Because I know that they'll
either come back

2637
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,720
"with knowledge and money,

2638
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,360
"but most importantly knowledge
of how you do it right,

2639
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:40,120
"or they'll hire Belarusians
from over there,

2640
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:43,640
"because they know them
and how to work with them,

2641
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:47,000
"thus we'll have money and
expertise flow our way."

2642
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:55,480
Okay, you get an A in GR for massaging
the Belarusians as an investor.

2643
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:57,040
Hold on, I was being honest!

2644
02:17:57,080 --> 02:18:03,800
Sure, but then how come the CEO of Wargaming
has been living on Cyprus for so many years?

It's not easy to run a big business
in Belarus. If you look at...

2646
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:12,840

Again, if the Belarusian government
supports all startuppers,

of the BIGGEST Belarusian corporation...

2648

And Prokopenia served prison time.

2649
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:18,280
And Prokopenia served prison time.

[Venture investor Viktor Prokopenia was detained]
[in spring of 2015 for unregistered business activity.]
[Prokopenia was released in late 2015.]
[In February of 2016, the case was dropped]
- Yeah. How come?
- I mean, that's insane!

2651
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:24,839
[Venture investor Viktor Prokopenia was detained]
[in spring of 2015 for unregistered business activity.]

I'm not saying they're
great and perfect.

[Venture investor Viktor Prokopenia was detained]
[in spring of 2015 for unregistered business activity.]

[In February of 2016, the case was dropped]
They're moving
in the right direction.

We don't even have
THAT in Russia!

2654
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:34,520
You know this joke about
Belarusian business?

2655
02:18:34,559 --> 02:18:38,119
Belarusian businessmen are like
passengers on a public bus:

2656
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:40,879
one half is sitting,
the other's shaking.

2657
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:43,080
(Davidov) Yeah...

2658
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,120
Then how can you say that..?

2659
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:49,560
If Elon Musk was Belarusian,
he'd still be sitting for PayPal.

2660
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,320
Popular joke. Also works for Russia.

2661
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:54,200
I'm not saying you should do
business in Belarus.

2662
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,960
That's just my answer to why
Belarusian IT is on the rise.

2663
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,480
It's a combination of
a non-existing market,

2664
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:04,120
lack of state meddling
in the early stages...

2665
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:07,160
If a Belarusian... Why do startuppers
do so well in Belarus?

2666
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,720
You can't rob them.
They have jack shit.

2667
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:11,240
And so they support them.

2668
02:19:11,559 --> 02:19:16,079
If they build a big company over there,
then sure, trouble will ensue.

2669
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:20,200
A ton of people will suddenly go:
"Hey, they've got money!"

2670
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:21,840
That makes sense.

2671
02:19:21,879 --> 02:19:25,919
But startuppers have nothing.
And there's no market.
And the country's dirt-poor.

2672
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:30,120
That's why the first thing you make
competes with Google.

2673
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:32,440
You have your own Skolkovo,
don't you?

2674
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,000
Hi-Tech Park.

2675
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:36,480
- And unlike Skolkovo, it works?
- Yeah.

2676
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:43,520
HTP is a state organization that
surrounds itself with tech companies.

2677
02:19:43,559 --> 02:19:48,680
The biggest benefit for these
companies is tax reduction.

2678
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:51,320
You have to meet certain criteria.

2679
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:54,520
You have to have a business plan.
You have to adhere to this plan.

2680
02:19:54,560 --> 02:20:00,440
Then they accept your company
as a resident of the HTP,

2681
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:04,680
and you pay reduced taxes.

2682
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:08,200
- Go create and develop?
- Yeah. But follow regulations.

2683
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:10,280
Regulations, sure.
It's in Minsk, right?

2684
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:14,040
The company doesn't necessarily
have to be somewhere physically.

2685
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:16,360
It could be located anywhere.

2686
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,000
So the Park doesn't exist?

2687
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:19,920
- It exists.
- Yeah?

2688
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:22,760
They have learning facilities,

2689
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:24,360
they have a coworking,

2690
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:28,280
they have offices for lease
for IT companies,

2691
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:32,000
but it's mostly spread around.

2692
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:36,000
(title card music)

2693
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,360
(muffled street sounds)

2694
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:41,240
[In 2020, the world faced the coronavirus pandemic.]

2695

[In 2020, the world faced the coronavirus pandemic.]
[In early March, the Silicon Valley instituted]
[a strict isolation policy]

2696
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,080
(Dud') How's your dog doing?
[In 2020, the world faced the coronavirus pandemic.]
[In early March, the Silicon Valley instituted]
[a strict isolation policy]

2697
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:49,400
The dog's doing wonderful.

2698
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:51,600
It's super happy.

2699
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:57,360
Some friends told me their dog had had
a rare injury — a dislocated tail.

2700
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:59,880
'Cause everyone's always at home,

2701
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:02,160
and it kept wagging its tail 24/7.

2702
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:05,040
Mine's holding in there.
She has a strong tail.

2703
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,840
(Dud') We showed off the Good House.

2704
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:10,280
[The Good House is the name of Doronichev's co-housing]
[project in San Francisco, where he shares his house]
[with Dumik and other startuppers]
This was all very sweet,
when people could come out.

2705
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:12,880
[The Good House is the name of Doronichev's co-housing]
[project in San Francisco, where he shares his house]
[with Dumik and other startuppers]
But without the freedom
to leave the house,

2706
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:13,560
[The Good House is the name of Doronichev's co-housing]
[project in San Francisco, where he shares his house]
[with Dumik and other startuppers]
is it still sunshine and rainbows?

2707
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,240
is it still sunshine and rainbows?

2708
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:21,720
I'm grateful that I'm facing
this situations in this house

2709
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,000
and in these circumstances,
because... Here's why.

2710
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:30,240
A friend called me the other day
and said: "Our house has a pool."

2711
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:34,760
"We're chilling in the pool."
I went:
"Well, my house... has people."

2712
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:39,880
"...Other people that you can
talk to from six feet away."

2713
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:42,320
He was like, "Daaamn!"
You know?

2714
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:47,320
- In these circumstances, your friends, family
and neighbors are priceless.
- He envies you?
- Of course!

2715
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,840
People to spend time in your
backyard with.

2716
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:55,000
We comply with the rules of isolation, of course.
We occupy different floors in the house,

2717
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:56,680
but it's a shared yard.

2718
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:59,960
We comply with the rules of isolation,
but we might go to the yard,

2719
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:06,160
sit down at a safe distance and talk,
drink tea or sing songs with a guitar.

2720
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:09,440
We do various events in Zoom.

2721
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:11,120
For example, my housemates...

2722
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:14,320
Dima Dumik started this cool

2723
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:17,440
dance in Zoom

2724
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:21,560
that brings together hundreds of
people from all over the world.

2725
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:26,080
Everyone's dancing at home,
but it's like they're dancing together.

2726
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:31,000
It proved to be a great workout,
both physically and mentally.

2727
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:35,680
Everyone in the Valley either worked
remotely or was prepared to.

2728
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:37,840
I.e., everyone had the infrastructure.

2729
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:40,920
So once the initial news from
China started coming in,

2730
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:44,640
people took their kids out of schools
and went into self-isolation.

2731
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:48,120
That view behind your back
is called self-isolation, right?

2732
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:55,320
I'm super lucky. I know that it's as if
I was preparing for this,

2733
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:58,400
for what's going on right now.

2734
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:02,280
I'm even luckier than it looks!
My in-laws are stuck here with us.

2735
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:04,480
Is it lucky though?

2736
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:07,760
Of course it is! They're saints!

2737
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:09,200
They tolerate my kids.

2738
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:12,120
When we started to go crazy
in the first two weeks,

2739
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:16,000
when you realize your bed's also
become your workplace

2740
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:20,680
where you can sometimes find chicken
bones from last night's dinner

2741
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:23,160
and where your cat naps,
all that stuff,

2742
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,680
we wanted to do something
about it.

2743
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:30,200
So my wife Tania put
a schedule on the wall

2744
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:33,480
and we started sort of
imitating a normalcy.

2745
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:37,200
We started to wake up on time,
put on our work clothes,

2746
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:42,600
go outside and walk in circles
around the house for half an hour

2747
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,960
to imitate the feeling of having
walked to school,

2748
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,040
come back inside and only then get
on our laptops and start working.

2749
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:53,040
That way, things started to resemble
our normal lives.

2750
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:56,680
We shot several hours of footage
exploring how the Valley worked,

2751
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:59,240
how startups were created,

2752
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,800
all those connections
and inspiring stories

2753
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:07,120
and all the other
interaction networks.

2754
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:09,560
Is it all now obsolete?

2755
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:14,360
No, it'll be that way forever.

2756
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:16,480
Some things will stay,
others will change.

2757
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:20,960
Some things will become much stronger,
others will probably go away forever.

2758
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:23,240
What do you think will
go away forever?

2759
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:31,240
I'd say, the excessive
prioritization of location will.

2760
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:34,480
It's one of the changes the Valley
was already moving towards.

2761
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:39,920
This microlocation: working specifically in
Mountain View or specifically in Palo Alto,

2762
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:41,760
or specifically in San Francisco.

2763
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:45,240
This was already slowly changing.

2764
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:48,800
Some had moved across
the Bay to Oakland

2765
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:53,400
simply because it was cheaper and
had more to offer to a family.

2766
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:56,040
Some had moved to
the surrounding suburbs.

2767
02:24:56,080 --> 02:25:01,160
Some Valley companies would go:
"We'll have hubs over here, here and here."

2768
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:02,080
For example, Square said:
"Our new hub is work from home."

2769
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:05,440
[Square is an American tech company that develops]
[solutions for receiving and processing online payments]
For example, Square said:
"Our new hub is work from home."

2770
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:07,800
[Square is an American tech company that develops]
[solutions for receiving and processing online payments]
Why was this localized
hyperconcentration so important?

2771
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,360
Why was this localized
hyperconcentration so important?

2772
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:15,200
Because you could meet up with anyone in the
industry in like 10 minutes, or just bump into them.

2773
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:16,640
It's like this magic soup.

2774
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:19,600
Now that this magic soup
has moved to Zoom,

2775
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:24,360
turns out, it's doesn't really matter
where you are physically.

2776
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,040
The spirit and the culture matter.

2777
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:30,240
Well, the spirit and the culture
will definitely persist.

2778
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:32,720
It's gonna be one big village,

2779
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:36,280
only spread out geographically.

2780
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:40,560
What about all the unique features
like competitiveness,

2781
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:43,800
the endless influx of fresh blood,

2782
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:47,520
the tolerance towards the crazy
and the unconventional,

2783
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:49,560
the tolerance to failure,

2784
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:52,840
Stanford as this citadel
of enlightenment

2785
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:57,400
that attracts fresh blood,
fresh minds and all that stuff?

2786
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:01,040
Will they all persist despite
the coronavirus

2787
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:05,480
and the fact that you don't have to
be next to others physically?

2788
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:10,280
Well done on the key feature
checklist, actually.

2789
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:11,920
Yeah, it'll all persist, of course.

2790
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:14,280
Social connections change too.

2791
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:16,520
It's not just harder to work —

2792
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:19,920
managers have a harder time
supervising their subordinates.

2793
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:24,680
Many managers switch to the so-called
"seagull management,"

2794
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:28,680
where you fly in, yell at and poop
on everyone and fly away agay.

2795
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:33,240
You don't actually know what
your people are doing,

2796
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:35,800
'cause you can't see them,
and it's all very unusual.

2797
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:39,720
When your toolset is lacking,
you turn into a seagull.

2798
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:42,280
(after laughing silently for 10 seconds straight)
"Seagull management!"

2799
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:44,760
Damn! So accurate!

2800
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:48,200
I recently read about some
guys from Ukraine

2801
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:50,520
that had founded a startup
for restaurants.

2802
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:55,600
Their app lets you order food before
you arrive at the restaurant.

2803
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:59,040
They were in the middle of raising
money, and you'd think

2804
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:03,000
that their startup would've
keeled over.

2805
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:08,560
But that's the thing about Valley mentality —
quick adaptability.

2806
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:12,560
They instantly repurposed their startup

2807
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:18,040
to help restaurants that never
offered takeout before

2808
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:21,160
quickly learn to process orders
and offer takeout.

2809
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:27,320
This adaptability to changing environment
is the very DNA of the Valley.

2810
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,000
We're witnessing it right now.

2811
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:32,560
Is Zoom the biggest company
of the coronavirus era?

2812
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:34,600
I believe so.

2813
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:36,440
Zoom and all the remote medicine
and remote education services.

2814
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:39,680
[Internet security experts call Zoom a fairly vulnerable app.]
[Hackers are abusing this. In early April 2020, thousands]
[of private video calls were uploaded to the internet]
Zoom and all the remote medicine
and remote education services.

2815
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:44,120
[Internet security experts call Zoom a fairly vulnerable app.]
[Hackers are abusing this. In early April 2020, thousands]
[of private video calls were uploaded to the internet]
There's a ton of non-consumer
companies that work with businesses

2816
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:45,800
[Internet security experts call Zoom a fairly vulnerable app.]
[Hackers are abusing this. In early April 2020, thousands]
[of private video calls were uploaded to the internet]
that also benefited
from the situation.

2817
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:47,720
But Zoom's up there of course.

2818
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:51,560
Zoom's user base increased twentyfold.

2819
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:55,560
- Twenty?
- From ten million to two hundred million.

2820
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:59,200
What is that if you convert it
into money?

2821
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:07,640
It's like a spike, but most people won't
actually renew their paid subscriptions.

2822
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:10,240
The important part is that user
habits are being changed.

2823
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:14,440
User habit has unbelievable momentum.

2824
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:20,880
When a company manages to turn its product
into a user habit for a large swath of people,

2825
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,160
that's guaranteed success.

2826
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:26,480
Zoom is currently becoming a user
habit for 200 million people.

2827
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:31,880
As a result, they'll multiply their money,
maybe not 20 times, but 10 times for sure.

2828
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,560
How much were they worth
before the corona?

2829
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:37,600
Their stock didn't go up by that much.
Maybe about 30%.

2830
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:41,440
Currently, Zoom's worth is like
Uber and Lyft combined.

2831
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:45,360
[Lyft is an American taxi service]
[and Uber's biggest competitor]
But that's not much more
than what it used to be.

2832
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:48,040
[Lyft is an American taxi service]
[and Uber's biggest competitor]
Because investors already had
high expectations for them.

2833
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:53,280
One, two or three companies that
thrived the most with corona?

2834
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:54,200
Mine did.

2835
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:57,040
Very humble!

2836
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:01,720
I'm not being coy. It's just easier
to talk about things that I know.

2837
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:05,840
We at Ecwid are super happy
that it didn't affect us much.

2838
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:09,840
In fact, we're having an easier
time now in some respects.

2839
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:16,480
The reason is, what we do is help businesses
go online, we've always been doing this.

2840
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:19,240
The demand for it
is now enormous.

2841
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:26,400
We've always been a work-from-
home-friendly business.

2842
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:30,680
We never had set work hours.
No one's supervised your presence.

2843
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,040
You could not show up at all.

2844
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,920
Previously, we used to be
work from home-friendly.

2845
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:38,160
Now, we're work from office-unfriendly.

2846
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:42,480
You used to choose between home and office.
Office is no longer an option, is all.

2847
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,120
That's why the transition
was so easy.

2848
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:50,520
We closed our offices much earlier than
you had to in California or in Russia.

2849
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,520
That part of organizing
work got easier.

2850
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:57,560
At the same time,
the demand tripled.

2851
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:00,560
In this context, we really
wanna act responsibly.

2852
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:04,520
The reason is because this is where
the Valley mentality comes into play.

2853
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:05,880
Which part of it?

2854
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:10,080
The part where you always shoot
to win big in the future

2855
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,840
rather than cash out today.

2856
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:15,600
We know we're good on money.

2857
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:20,840
When small businesses
face this kind of shit,

2858
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:23,040
our purpose is to help them.

2859
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:26,760
That's why we... We had free
programs to begin with.

2860
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:29,320
We considerably expanded
our free programs.

2861
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:32,280
Made some previously paid
programs free.

2862
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:34,760
Stuff like gift certificate support.

2863
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:36,640
Businesses that had to
close down...

2864
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:40,360
There's a local trend over here:
support your local food place.

2865
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:43,960
(Dud') It's basically like futures
or donations, right?

2866
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,640
Yeah, yeah. It's exactly that.

2867
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:49,400
We moved those things to our free
programs to help those guys out.

2868
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:56,080
We offer free... On a number of programs,
we just said: "We're charging you nothing in 2020."

2869
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:57,640
"It's a bad year."

2870
02:30:57,880 --> 02:31:00,400
"Leap year."

2871
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:05,240
"Let's not bring up money this year.
Just use our services."

2872
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:09,760
It's super important, because there's
a concept in the Valley

2873
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:12,160
called "long-term customer value,"
or LTV.

2874
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:17,000
Your current profit is not as important
as this LTV statistic.

2875
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:20,360
Are there any companies that
the corona straight up killed off?

2876
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,120
Of course there are.
It killed off travel firms.

2877
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:26,160
What about the big players?
The brands that we're used to.

2878
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,280
Most of those brands
will get bailed out.

2879
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:30,640
If it's an American brand,

2880
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:32,640
Expedia, Booking.com,

2881
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:35,360
all the airlines —
they'll bail 'em out.

2882
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:38,160
They just print money for them,

2883
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:41,360
essentially distributing their
losses across the nation.

2884
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:46,520
In case of America, across the world, because
everyone depends on the dollar more or less.

2885
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,360
Is it the government
that does this?

2886
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,280
Yes, it's the government.

2887
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:55,960
The government understands that a controlled
economic loss is a lesser evil

2888
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:02,240
than 100,000 unemployed
in a certain business sector.

2889
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,240
That's for a small sector.

2890
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:09,520
For a large sector like air travel,
it could turn way uglier.

2891
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:11,920
What do you think is gonna
happen to Tesla?

2892
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:16,440
On our way to the Valley, we wanted
to test the Russian stereotypes like

2893
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:19,480
"Musk is clueless!"

2894
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:22,040
"Tesla is a bubble!"

2895
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:25,320
Everyone we met told us
that it wasn't a bubble,

2896
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:28,440
that they had infrastructure,
a product, yadda yadda.

2897
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:29,440
What about now?

2898
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:31,040
Tesla is a great company.

2899
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:33,000
I have...

2900
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:36,680
I dunno. Don't wanna stumble
around with the camera.

2901
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:40,600
But I have a disassembled
bike outside.

2902
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:42,960
I removed its battery,

2903
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,560
'cause it's outta juice,

2904
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,960
and I don't wanna go to the station
to touch any hoses. It can wait.

2905
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,360
Car's empty too.

2906
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:53,840
But Tesla is the only vehicle
I drive these days.

2907
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:55,960
Because it's always charged.

2908
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,800
Solar batteries on the roof.

2909
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:02,200
It's complete autonomy.
I don't need anyone.

2910
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:04,560
I love driving it. Moreover...

2911
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,320
Is it a perfect company from
customer's point of view? No.

2912
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:13,040
For example, I have to repair their
fancy extending handles all the time.

2913
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:15,200
I recently called in Tesla service.

2914
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:17,520
Again, they're perfectly
adapted to this world.

2915
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:20,800
- Because I scheduled the visit
through their app.
- Ohh!

2916
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:25,480
The guy came over. It's mobile service!
You don't have to go anywhere.
They come to you.

2917
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:28,120
They fixed the handle and left.

2918
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:31,960
I got a notification from the app
to pay for the service and I did.

2919
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,360
That was it. They're perfectly
adapted to the corona world.

2920
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:38,160
The corona world will obviously
come to an end. Tesla will stay.

2921
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:40,840
It's a great company.
It's a great idea.

2922
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,960
I'm sure Musk will figure it out.

2923
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,520
I went to the vet to get my dog's
teeth checked up.

2924
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:50,440
I made an appointment.

2925
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:53,760
They said: "When you arrive,
don't leave your car. Just call us."

2926
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:58,480
I go there. It's all covered in signs saying
"Don't leave car," "Don't go inside."

2927
02:33:58,520 --> 02:34:00,480
I called them, said I was there.

2928
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:02,680
A nurse came out,

2929
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:06,200
took the dog without
touching me or the car

2930
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:08,920
and from a considerable
distance.

2931
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:11,760
She went inside, and the doc
called me on the phone.

2932
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:16,560
The doc and I talked on the phone the whole
way through. I explained everything.

2933
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:20,240
Of course I'd filled out
all the forms online prior.

2934
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:23,840
Afterward, they gave the dog back
to me, again no contact,

2935
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:30,920
and called and said: "Please, give us your bank
card and insurance details so we could bill you."

2936
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:34,720
Some tiny four-doctor vet
clinic in this village

2937
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:37,600
turned into an online
operation in just one week,

2938
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:43,080
digitized in every way: online payments,
online desk, online forms, e-signatures.

2939
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:44,440
That's cool!

2940
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:46,800
I hope all business will do this.

2941
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:50,480
'Cause I always hated waiting
in line at the vet clinic.

2942
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:56,520
Must say, I was never a follower of this
idea that the Valley was our savior,

2943
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:58,720
that technology was everything.

2944
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:01,920
I've always been skeptical
about these things:

2945
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,760
"Are we sure we're doing a good thing,
or have we gone too far?"

2946
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:08,640
But in this particular situation,
thanks to the Valley,

2947
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:11,680
half of the world kept
going in some capacity.

2948
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:14,440
We continue shopping,
ordering food,

2949
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:17,560
going to school via Zoom,
working, et cetera.

2950
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:20,920
Maybe this is wishful thinking,

2951
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:26,280
but we figured that the place world
repair solutions would come from,

2952
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:30,120
'cause the world will obviously require
repairs on a ton of its systems,

2953
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,760
will be the Valley,
and places like it,

2954
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:39,400
where you've got brains, money and
an established and sustainable setup

2955
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:43,360
for said brains and money to work in tandem
for the betterment of the world.

2956
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:46,040
Am I comforting myself here,

2957
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:48,680
praying I don't end up jobless,

2958
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,720
or does this ring true?

2959
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:54,560
It does ring true. 'Cause even though
new connections aren't being made,

2960
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:58,160
the brains and the money
haven't gone anywhere.

2961
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:00,400
Neither has this place's
unique culture,

2962
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:06,760
the culture of people who want to change
the world, improve it, help others —

2963
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:10,520
all those local themes.

2964
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:13,880
Each place has its own theme.

2965
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:17,400
In Moscow, people want
to make money.

2966
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:21,640
In New York, people want influence.

2967
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,920
In the Valley, people want
to change the world.

2968
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:28,240
Money is a means

2969
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:31,880
and influence is a means to change
the world and leave your mark.

2970
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:37,080
Whom do people envy here?
Those who left a mark.

2971
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:41,120
Those who created something which
changed people's user habits.

2972
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:47,080
Certainly, being with a group of people,
sharing the same physical space,

2973
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:50,960
when it comes to creative
and artistic jobs,

2974
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,840
you usually perform better
and more efficiently.

2975
02:36:55,880 --> 02:36:58,040
There is a sort of magic
of presence.

2976
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,720
We do sorely miss it.

2977
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:02,760
My productivity has dropped
dramatically.

2978
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:04,480
Probably, by 50%.

2979
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:07,000
I keep hearing it from
others too.

2980
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,200
Meanwhile, all my colleagues
and I work more hours.

2981
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:13,680
We spend more time
in video conferences.

2982
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:15,680
But we get less work done.

2983
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:18,240
So this sort of magic of human
communication

2984
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:22,760
that you create with campuses, offices
and all kinds of artistic spaces,

2985
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:25,240
it's missing right now.

2986
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:31,000
But again, I think we'll adapt and might
even say we don't need any campuses.

2987
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:37,080
Though we'll probably revert after realizing that we do
need physical communication and interaction.

2988
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:40,200
Free food isn't going
away though, is it?

2989
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:44,160
(laughs) I believe they'll keep
the free food.

2990
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:46,800
Yeah, I think the free food
will stay.

2991
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:48,800
Serioga sighed in relief!

2992
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:53,480
(laughs) Serioga, come over!
We'll get you fed! (laughs)

2993
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:55,880
As soon as they lift the ban,
come over, dude!

2994
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,680
(title card music)

2995
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:03,600
I understand that lately, more people
are coming specifically from Russia?

2996
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,640
- You mean compared to Russia
previously?
- Yeah.

2997
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:13,400
There was a spike, a couple of spikes, when
a lot of great NEW people came here.

2998
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:18,120
I found myself surrounded
by people

2999
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:22,440
whom I doubt I would've been able
to even meet in Moscow.

3000
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:24,120
Given how great they are.

3001
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:26,760
- Super talented guys.
- When was the spike?

3002
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:31,480
After the launch of the Crimean campaign,
a lot of people moved here.

3003
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:34,880
Did people start to flock here
after 2014?

3004
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:37,080
In droves.

3005
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:41,640
I was coming here knowing that two or three
people I knew had moved here before me.

3006
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:45,040
I thought, "Okay,
I'll find people to talk to."

3007
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:48,920
I moved and I started getting
messaged every day:

3008
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:51,880
"Hey, Kolian! I moved too. Can you
clue me in on what's where?"

3009
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:55,240
"What's up with local schools?
Where do I drop off my kids?"

3010
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:57,680
Half of my course mates
had moved.

3011
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:00,520
- What course?
- Like 15 people I went to college with.

3012
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:03,680
- What course though?
- This was... Management Faculty.

3013
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:06,040
Like 15 people from one course.

3014
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,440
Out of, what, 200 people?

3015
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,320
They were probably
the bottom, right?

3016
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:13,920
That's the thing: people that moved
were the best of the best.

3017
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:18,880
When programmers approach you these days,
in whatever way, and ask for advice:

3018
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:21,920
"Should I move there?
Over there?"

3019
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:23,000
What do you tell them?

3020
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:26,400
- It's a sore subject for me.
- Pray tell?

3021
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:28,760
I'm a serial migrant. I jumped
countries several times.

3022
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:30,640
My base motive was...

3023
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:33,320
There were a bunch. I'd come up
with business-related reasons too.

3024
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:36,560
[*Derogatory name for Russia, made using its]
[English name and the diminutive suffix K.]
But I think the reality is very simple.
I was one of many who went:
"Gotta skip Rushka*!"

3025
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:38,400
This sort of popular sentiment.

3026
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:41,080
- Awful.
- It is awful! It's so dumb.

3027
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:46,160
People don't understand that leaving your
country, usually, you're not the bottom.

3028
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:49,840
They lament their living, but they're usually not
doing the worst in their country at the time.

3029
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:53,960
When you move to another country,
you're resetting your social status.

3030
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,720
As a migrant, you have to
develop new skills.

3031
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:01,240
Most of the time, it's a net loss.

3032
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:05,400
It differs from case to case, but usually,
emigration is a big mistake.

3033
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:07,200
People don't get this for
one simple reason.

3034
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:11,280
Their peers that left earlier
are a bad influence.

3035
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:12,640
Here's how it works.

3036
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:14,200
Their what?

3037
02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:17,600
People among their social
connections who'd left.

3038
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:20,720
In reality, you'll feel awful
after migrating. Honestly.

3039
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:22,680
It's not just me.
I watch other people.

3040
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:26,560
There are a ton of downsides
to migrating.

3041
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:31,000
No migrant will ever admit
that they're unhappy.

3042
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:33,280
I have a pretty bloated ego,

3043
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:36,040
so I can easily admit these
things without hurting it.

3044
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,600
I can admit certain soar spots.

3045
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:42,680
But most people can't. Admitting they'd made
a big mistake would hurt too much.

3046
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,040
They can't come back.

3047
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:45,520
Why? 'Cause they're weak?

3048
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:47,600
Well, because you...
Most people will...

3049
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:50,000
I have enough money.

3050
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:54,960
I can move at any time. It'll cost me
a ton of money, but I don't mind.

3051
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,160
Someone else will have committed. They'll have
gotten a new place, sold their old one.

3052
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:01,720
This moving transaction is pretty expensive.
And you usually can't go back anymore.

3053
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:03,720
It's also a very tough decision.

3054
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:06,280
I remember how tough
it was to go back. Twice.

3055
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:09,480
I made this decision twice. And both
times, I had to force myself.

3056
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:11,600
"You giving up?"
And so on.

3057
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:12,720
But I made it.

3058
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:17,600
A typical person can't admit
this was a bad decision.

3059
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:22,920
What they can do is project
happiness towards home,

3060
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:25,080
because they can't project
happiness to the locals.

3061
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:27,200
Locals probably get paid more
for the same work.

3062
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:28,920
Locals live in a better
neighborhood.

3063
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:31,040
They'll be doing so-so
compared to the locals.

3064
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:34,480
But because there are others back
in Russia with a dream to LEAVE,

3065
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:36,760
and since they'd made it,

3066
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:42,040
they get this affirmation that they
did the right thing through others.

3067
02:41:42,080 --> 02:41:44,560
They project "I did good" on their
former countrymen.

3068
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:46,200
Everybody dreams of the Valley,
don't they?

3069
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,520
Not everybody.

3070
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:50,920
A lot of people are like,
I don't wanna go anywhere.

3071
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:54,440
Many say: "Screw your Valley.
It sucks. I wanna live in Europe."

3072
02:41:55,360 --> 02:41:58,040
- Do they tether themselves to Russia?
- Many do, yeah.

3073
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,320
What do they do?

3074
02:41:59,360 --> 02:42:01,960
Work for people who moved West

3075
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,240
or for Western companies,

3076
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:06,720
or Chinese companies.

3077
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:08,840
- What about our companies?
- Or for the state.

3078
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,600
Or for the state?

3079
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:13,080
You consider Yandex
state-owned too now?

3080
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:17,240
No, it isn't yet. They soon will be.
But they're holding in there.

3081
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:22,120
- They're like an islet of freedom.
- Does watching things unravel around
Yandex make you upset?

3082
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:24,680
- It makes me very upset.
- What particularly upsets you?

3083
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:32,200
You know, from the beginning, Yandex
was probably the most independent

3084
02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:35,200
island in the independent
sea of internet.

3085
02:42:35,240 --> 02:42:39,360
The culture of this company was mostly
built by Ilya Segalovich.

3086
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:40,600
[Ilya Segalovich co-founded Yandex.]
[He died in 2013]
The culture of this company was mostly
built by Ilya Segalovich.

3087
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:44,400
[Ilya Segalovich co-founded Yandex.]
[He died in 2013]
After he died, Yandex started
changing from the inside.

3088
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:48,640
With constant external pressure,
it started to bend.

3089
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:50,480
I don't it would have
if Ilya was around.

3090
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:52,480
Simple, obvious question.

3091
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:55,000
Why was your goal
to teach here,

3092
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:58,920
rather than in MSU or NES
or any other place?

3093
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:01,560
[NES, New Economic School,]
[private economic school in Moscow]
Why outside of Russia?

3094
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,040
The most important thing for
a scientist is the community.

3095
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:08,000
Second most important
are the students.

3096
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:10,320
By "community" I mean
the research community.

3097
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:16,200
You wanna work with accomplished people
who are smart and interesting to talk to.

3098
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:20,480
Top universities usually have
very interesting research staffs.

3099
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:28,400
In Stanford, each professor is not only
a leader in their area of expertise,

3100
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:31,480
but also an incredibly
interesting person to talk to

3101
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:35,080
about science... and not just science.
That's one.

3102
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:37,640
Two, the students.

3103
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:40,880
Quality of students here
is absolutely superb.

3104
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:43,920
Third, surprisingly important

3105
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:46,480
and something I didn't
fully appreciate at first

3106
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:52,480
was that Stanford University is very
tolerant towards what you do.

3107
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:55,720
On the one hand, you have to
achieve incredible success,

3108
02:43:55,760 --> 02:44:00,760
because sooner or later, they have to
give or deny you tenure.

3109
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:06,080
[Tenure is an indefinite contract with a professor]
At some point, they'll make a judgment on whether
you'd become an apex scientist in your field.

3110
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:08,440
But they're very calm about:

3111
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:13,200
what research papers you write,
whom you do research with,

3112
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:15,880
what specific subject
you're studying.

3113
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:18,600
This freedom of research...

3114
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:21,520
You know? You want
room to breathe!

3115
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:25,040
Freedom of research is
unbelievably advanced here.

3116
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:29,560
It's one of the things for which
I'm so grateful to this university.

3117
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:34,040
Because when I first came here,
I was researching one thing,
and achieved success there.

3118
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:40,520
But afterward, since I'd moved to work at
a university in the middle of Silicon Valley,

3119
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:43,600
over the course of several years,
I got interested in a different subject.

3120
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:49,120
I became interested in venture capital,
corporate innovation, et cetera.

3121
02:44:49,160 --> 02:44:54,400
And I believe I would've had a harder time
switching gears at a lot of other research centers.

3122
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:56,440
Down here, it was very simple.

3123
02:44:56,480 --> 02:45:00,200
All the young boys and girls
watching now, thinking:

3124
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:02,920
"That's it! I'm applying
to a tech faculty!"

3125
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:08,640
"I wanna work at Google, or Facebook,
or something like that!"

3126
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:10,880
Is there potential for
disappointment?

3127
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:12,880
Of course. They WILL be
disappointed!

3128
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:16,200
Could they run into a global,
strategic blunder

3129
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:19,520
of the fact that in ten years, the world won't
need this many software engineers?

3130
02:45:19,560 --> 02:45:23,920
If they chase a made-up
goal like this,

3131
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:25,680
they WILL end up disappointed.

3132
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:30,120
I think if you pursue a particular area
only because someone told you

3133
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:32,680
there's money in it, you might
be disappointed.

3134
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:34,680
If you pursue your passion,

3135
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:38,480
which will itself reinforce ambition for
perfection and perpetual curiosity,

3136
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:40,400
you'll do great.

3137
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:44,240
You said a lot of things in Russia
distracted from doing business.

3138
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,640
- Yeah.
- What exactly?

3139
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:47,880
There's always a sort of
uncertainty.

3140
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:51,160
Stuff like: will I get a surprise
inspection today?

3141
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:54,360
As soon as you reach a certain level,
they might become interested in you.

3142
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:55,720
I mean...

3143
02:45:55,760 --> 02:46:01,800
Also, the legal side of doing
business is rather...

3144
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:07,400
It takes a lot more resources
than some place like America.

3145
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:09,800
There are cases where...

3146
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,800
For example, Fiodor Ovchinnikov,
the founder of Dodo Pizza...

3147
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:16,160
Cops found drugs in the bathroom
of one of the restaurants

3148
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:20,240
[In February and May of 2018, Ovchinnikov was questioned]
[as a witness after an anonymous tip that his pizzeria]
[chain was a foil for a distribution network of Latin American]
[drugs. According to the detective, drug stashes]
[were found in several restaurants of the chain.]
[Ovchinnikov said that this was an attempt to frame him]
and started dragging him from one
legal agency to another.

3149
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:21,240
[In February and May of 2018, Ovchinnikov was questioned]
[as a witness after an anonymous tip that his pizzeria]
[chain was a foil for a distribution network of Latin American]
[drugs. According to the detective, drug stashes]
[were found in several restaurants of the chain.]
[Ovchinnikov said that this was an attempt to frame him]

3150
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:25,600
[In February and May of 2018, Ovchinnikov was questioned]
[as a witness after an anonymous tip that his pizzeria]
[chain was a foil for a distribution network of Latin American]
[drugs. According to the detective, drug stashes]
[were found in several restaurants of the chain.]
[Ovchinnikov said that this was an attempt to frame him]
- He created a... He's from Siktivkar, isn't he?
- Yeah.

3151
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:26,680
[In February and May of 2018, Ovchinnikov was questioned]
[as a witness after an anonymous tip that his pizzeria]
[chain was a foil for a distribution network of Latin American]
[drugs. According to the detective, drug stashes]
[were found in several restaurants of the chain.]
[Ovchinnikov said that this was an attempt to frame him]
He created an amazing company
with lots of positive energy.

3152
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:29,400
He created an amazing company
with lots of positive energy.

3153
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:32,040
It's a global pizza chain, right?

3154
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:36,360
[Dodo Pizza has over 600 restaurants in 13 countries]
But they search him in Russia and start
this whole drug affair. It's absurd.

3155
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:39,960
As soon as you become someone,
they'll come to collect.

3156
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,680
Or this business where they

3157
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:45,600
clamp down on the freedom
of speech.

3158
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:47,440
Say, you've created VK.

3159
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:51,840
You have this new media with
communities for oppositionists.

3160
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:54,160
They start clipping your wings.

3161
02:46:54,200 --> 02:47:00,080
Those are the differences and
limitations that I don't much care for,

3162
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:04,120
because they're in the way
of my goals.

3163
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:07,360
It's not a bad thing, is it?

3164
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:09,480
The Belarusians said it best:

3165
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:11,960
the fact that we left was
great for the country.

3166
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,760
Because... Think about it. I invest
a ton of money in Russia myself.

3167
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:20,120
I pay a shit ton of taxes
in Russia.

3168
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:24,680
A lot more than what I was
paying when I lived there.

3169
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:29,480
I've created a couple
hundred jobs in Russia.

3170
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:30,920
What do you do there?

3171
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:34,160
Development of a bunch of
companies from our portfolio.

3172
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:40,000
Wait, but I thought it was better if people like that lived in their home country?

3173
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:42,000
They're open to the world
and stuff.

3174
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:45,120
I mean, they leave and don't plan
to come back, do they?

3175
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:48,400
- I mean those 15 from your course?
- Quite the opposite.

3176
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:51,000
We're all very different in that...

3177
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:53,000
People from the sausage migration
wave were leaving to leave.

3178
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:54,600
["Sausage migration" denotes people who left late]
[USSR and early Russia in late '80s and early '90s]
People from the sausage migration
wave were leaving to leave.

3179
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:57,320
["Sausage migration" denotes people who left late]
[USSR and early Russia in late '80s and early '90s]
They were going AWAY,
not TO.

3180
02:47:57,360 --> 02:47:59,320
We left TO and IN ORDER TO.

3181
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:01,240
We left to learn.

3182
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:04,600
We left to achieve something,

3183
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:06,080
driven by ambitions.

3184
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:10,920
We also left knowing that
the world had changed.

3185
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:15,680
In 2016, when we were moving,
the borders were a lot more fluid.

3186
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:20,320
Our biggest fear was that they could close
the borders and we wouldn't be able to return.

3187
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:23,560
The beauty of the situation
is that we travel freely.

3188
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:29,360
I could find myself in Moscow tomorrow,
meeting with someone, doing business.

3189
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:32,640
The day after, I'll be in Singapore.
Then back here again.

3190
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:34,280
That's great!

3191
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:40,080
I've never encouraged anyone
to move away or run from something.

3192
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:42,360
I get it that sometimes
you have to.

3193
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,720
I've never done that.
I always moved TOWARDS.

3194
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:49,920
If you believe that the place you're going to
has something that will help you achieve...

3195
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:52,840
or just do something optimally,

3196
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:54,520
dude, pack up and leave.

3197
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:59,560
If you can't explain why you'll be more
efficient there than anywhere else,

3198
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:02,080
you should think about it
and figure things out.

3199
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:05,040
I believe it's much more important...
I think I told you this.

3200
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:10,680
I believe it's much more important to live
for the things you were born for

3201
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,800
rather than to live in the place
where you were born.

3202
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:15,640
I think it's fine. The world's
gotten a lot smaller.

3203
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:17,960
You can travel and move
at will.

3204
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:22,520
If there's a place that lets you do what you
wanna do, you should pack up and go.

3205
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:28,080
Without fear. Know that it's gonna be
tough but that you can persevere.

3206
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:33,120
But moving just because this place is bad and
somewhere else will be better for some reason,

3207
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:34,600
that's completely different.

3208
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:38,280
I doubt it will... It seldom leads to
success and happiness.

3209
02:49:38,320 --> 02:49:39,440
When you...

3210
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:42,440
When you HAVE TO leave,
you leave. I get it.

3211
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:47,480
But the people that believe that the grass
is greener on the other side,

3212
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:49,680
as a rule, eventually suffer
disappointment.

3213
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:54,240
(title card music)

3214
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:59,480
Here's how our attitude changed over 
the course of these days in the Valley.

3215
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:03,600
Initially, we were thinking: 
what a strange world.

3216
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:07,960
Then we realized that every 
person you meet here

3217
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,160
is either a startupper 
or an investor.

3218
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:14,000
Last night, I was already thinking 
of investing into something.

3219
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:16,240
(laughs) Caught the bug, huh?

3220
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:19,240
Yeah. I have a certain amount 
of money put aside.

3221
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:23,960
Thought I'd store it away for a rainy day 
or for the college fund or whatever.

3222
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,600
- Now I'm looking for a startup to invest into.
- What for?

3223
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:29,160
- What for?
- Yeah.

3224
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:32,440
- Well, first, this is interesting.
- Good.

3225
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:36,400
I feel that this leads
to new knowledge.

3226
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:42,200
If I invest into something, then obviously,
 I'll get invested in the matter intellectually too.

3227
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:44,800
And third, it's a backup plan.

3228
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:46,920
You have good motivation.

3229
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:51,240
Some people coming here say: "I have 50 mil 
over here. Looking where to park 'em."

3230
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:52,920
That's not a very good idea.

3231
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:58,240
If your primary motivation is, "I wanna learn; 
I wanna help create something big;

3232
02:50:58,280 --> 02:51:02,640
"I'm not afraid to lose money on this because 
only 1 out of my 100 investments paid out,"

3233
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:04,000
then you should start investing.

3234
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:07,280
Though I never liked America.
I never thought I'd move to America.

3235
02:51:07,320 --> 02:51:09,680
I'd been to America many times, 
obviously.

3236
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:11,480
This place particularly, 
on business.

3237
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:13,800
But I never thought I'd live here.

3238
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:19,160
But then I came here and felt like
 I was at Yandex's campus.

3239
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:24,440
Bunch of smiling faces with 
excitement in their eyes.

3240
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:30,040
People on hoverboards working 
to change the future.

3241
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:31,840
It felt a lot like Yandex' campus.

3242
02:51:31,960 --> 02:51:35,600
That's what I meant: 
the Valley is the product 

3243
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:38,400
of a critical mass of people 
creating a particular climate.

3244
02:51:38,440 --> 02:51:41,120
You're now in it, and it's 
working its magic.

3245
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:44,720
But it's exactly like the gold rush!

3246
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:49,400
- Many are investing, admit it, 
only to get rich.
- Yes.

3247
02:51:49,880 --> 02:51:51,920
And that's normal. That's capitalism.

3248
02:51:51,960 --> 02:51:56,040
But the difference between the gold rush
 and what we're seeing today

3249
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:58,280
is that gold you need to find

3250
02:51:58,560 --> 02:51:59,920
and then share.

3251
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:01,960
Ideas you have to create,

3252
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:05,600
and you can create them infinitely. 
You know?

3253
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:07,520
They multiply too.

3254
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:11,280
One good idea yields two better ones, 
and so on and so forth.

3255
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:13,320
It's like a snowball effect.

3256
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:15,600
That's the uniqueness of NOW.

3257
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:19,960
It's not another gold rush.
It's not a zero-sum game,

3258
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,440
where your gain is 
someone else's loss.

3259
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:25,000
It's a place where people co-create.

3260
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:27,840
And the ecosystem of this 
place only gets better.

3261
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:32,840
For example, the iPhone allowed 
YouTube to become better,

3262
02:52:32,880 --> 02:52:35,840
even though Google and Apple 
are competitors.

3263
02:52:35,880 --> 02:52:39,400
Then Facebook, technically 
a competitor to both of them,

3264
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:41,160
further enhanced this ecosystem,

3265
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:44,960
because it allowed you to share 
YouTube links and so on.

3266
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:49,360
Each company you build into this structure, 
technically a competitor to everyone else,

3267
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:51,840
in reality, they all enhance each other.

3268
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:56,160
This place wasn't born 10, or 20, 
or even 50 years ago.

3269
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:57,240
150 years ago.

3270
02:52:57,280 --> 02:53:03,760
170. In 1849, when the gold
 rush started here.

3271
02:53:03,800 --> 02:53:06,520
All of this is the fruit
 of the gold rush.

3272
02:53:06,560 --> 02:53:12,920
It's the mentality of people striking dirt with 
a pickaxe in hopes of finding a shit ton of gold.

3273
02:53:12,960 --> 02:53:17,520
- Same thing. They're perpetually consumed 
by the gold rush here.
- So nothing changed?

3274
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:22,360
When everyone was going crazy about 
cryptocurrencies in Russia: "Bitcoin! Buy it!"

3275
02:53:22,400 --> 02:53:26,280
[*One of the largest Ponzi schemes in history]
[that operated in the 1990s.]
this was probably the first
 Russian gold rush after MMM*.

3276
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:28,280
- Yeah.
- No one even noticed it here.

3277
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:31,440
Because something like this
 happens here every 15 days.

3278
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:38,080
Romania, Belarus, Indonesia, India, France — 
they all tried to build a "Silicon Valley killer."

3279
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:40,880
But that's impossible. At best, you can 
build something of its own.

3280
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:45,320
Because this place is a combination 
of investment capital,

3281
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:46,800
positive thinking,

3282
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:51,000
Stanford and military research 
that took place after WWII.

3283
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:56,080
(Davidov) It emerged on its own around 
Stanford and a few other local universities:

3284
02:53:56,120 --> 02:54:00,240
University of San Francisco, Berkeley 
and Santa Clara University.

3285
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:06,280
DARPA, basically an American defense
 agency for strategic initiatives,

3286
02:54:06,320 --> 02:54:09,440
would give out grants to scientists 
for all kinds of shit.

3287
02:54:09,480 --> 02:54:13,680
During the Vietnam War, 
they researched telepathy,

3288
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:18,880
trying to figure out if they could launch 
psychokinetic attacks on people.

3289
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:20,400
They funded that too.

3290
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:23,080
They had this broad 
investment program.

3291
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:27,920
They also started funding local 
university research labs

3292
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:33,120
that gathered teams of people, 
protected by American law,

3293
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:37,280
who started developing things that 
could potentially be commercialized.

3294
02:54:37,320 --> 02:54:39,960
People started investing 
money into this stuff.

3295
02:54:40,400 --> 02:54:45,440
When it got big and started making money,
 those initial investors became so rich

3296
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:49,880
that people who heeded them 
also started investing into this place.

3297
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:55,440
State financing, military research, 
development of IT and internet —

3298
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:58,960
amalgamation of all these factors 
led to the birth of the Valley.

3299
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
You can't duplicate it. But you can 
create something different.

3300
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:03,080
Not even in Skolkovo?!

3301
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:07,440
(laughs)

3302
02:55:07,480 --> 02:55:10,080
What's the best way to put it?

3303
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:15,600
I can see that Russia is trying, 
and we have some good companies.

3304
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:17,040
Everyone knows Playrix, 
Kaspersky, Yandex.

3305
02:55:17,080 --> 02:55:19,280
[Playrix is a mobile game developer founded in 2004]
[in Vologda by brothers Dmitriy and Igor Bouhman.]
[Combined monthly audience of Playrix's games]
[is over 100,000,000 users]
Everyone knows Playrix, 
Kaspersky, Yandex.

3306
02:55:19,320 --> 02:55:23,240
[Playrix is a mobile game developer founded in 2004]
[in Vologda by brothers Dmitriy and Igor Bouhman.]
[Combined monthly audience of Playrix's games]
[is over 100,000,000 users]
Yandex makes drones, 
some of the best in the world too.

3307
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:25,560
[Playrix is a mobile game developer founded in 2004]
[in Vologda by brothers Dmitriy and Igor Bouhman.]
[Combined monthly audience of Playrix's games]
[is over 100,000,000 users]
We have our own way. 
And it's great.

3308
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:29,520
But no one's managed to copypaste 
the Valley. And you don't need to.

3309
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:33,120
You mean Skolkovo is a valid 
part of our path too?

3310
02:55:33,440 --> 02:55:35,360
Out of the things I've seen 
in Skolkovo, 

3311
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:38,880
I don't believe there was a single startup 
that had succeeded globally.

3312
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:42,280
On our way here, I stumbled upon 
a video I hadn't seen before.

3313
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:48,400
It was an NTV report about Dmitriy 
Medvedev's visit to the Silicon Valley.

3314
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:51,720
He says: "We'll open a Skolkovo 
branch in the Valley."

3315
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:54,480
Today, this sounds like a bad joke.

3316
02:55:54,520 --> 02:55:56,120
What's wrong with Skolkovo?

3317
02:55:57,440 --> 02:56:00,320
This is a tough and 
complex question.

3318
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:05,080
The groundwork was good. 
Lots of typical Russian

3319
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:07,760
problems got in the way.

3320
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:11,280
One of them is corruption. 
Another one is politics.

3321
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:16,360
Third one is struggle over 
resource control.

3322
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:18,960
Which is basically a mix 
of corruption and politics.

3323
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:21,560
That's what happened in Skolkovo.

3324
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:24,400
Has Skolkovo produced anything?

3325
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:26,000
I don't believe so —

3326
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:31,360
if we're talking about things other than their 
business school, which is doing SOMETHING.

3327
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:34,000
The Skolkovo technopark itself...

3328
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:38,040
I've not seen anything good 
over there.

3329
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:43,080
Let me ask you as someone who wants 
good things in Russia too:

3330
02:56:43,360 --> 02:56:45,920
why is the Valley possible 
across the ocean,

3331
02:56:45,960 --> 02:56:47,240
but in our country,

3332
02:56:47,560 --> 02:56:49,960
somewhere in the Krasnodar Kray,

3333
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,880
someplace near the sea,
or anywhere else,

3334
02:56:54,080 --> 02:56:57,160
in Skolkovo, I know how tasteless
mentioning it here is,

3335
02:56:57,200 --> 02:56:58,800
it's totally impossible?

3336
02:56:58,840 --> 02:57:00,280
You just answered it.

3337
02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:02,680
You started with a similar place.

3338
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:04,840
When they build in Russia, 
they first pick a place:

3339
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:07,520
"Let's build a think tank!"

3340
02:57:07,560 --> 02:57:11,640
"Software engineers are like cockroaches! 
We need to put a cardboard box on top of them."

3341
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:13,840
"Then it's A-OK from there!"

3342
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:18,560
In reality, you need to invest in the ecosystem, 
in the sauce, in human interaction.

3343
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:21,360
So what you're saying is, 
creating something like this, 

3344
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:23,680
instead of copying geography, 
you wanna build up

3345
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:25,040
a place like Akademgorodok 
in Novosibirsk.

3346
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:25,880
[Akademgorodok is a research institute community]
[that gathered scientists from all over the USSR.]
[Founded in 1957 near Novosibirsk]
a place like Akademgorodok 
in Novosibirsk.

3347
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:27,080
[Akademgorodok is a research institute community]
[that gathered scientists from all over the USSR.]
[Founded in 1957 near Novosibirsk]
Yeah, exactly!

3348
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:29,560
[Akademgorodok is a research institute community]
[that gathered scientists from all over the USSR.]
[Founded in 1957 near Novosibirsk]
Why aren't they doing it?

3349
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:30,880
[Akademgorodok is a research institute community]
[that gathered scientists from all over the USSR.]
[Founded in 1957 near Novosibirsk]
Time. Networking and time.

3350
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:34,520
You wanna switch things 
around less.

3351
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:38,760
Let people grow. 
Keep them from dispersing.

3352
02:57:38,800 --> 02:57:42,640
'Cause a lot of the time, reaching certain 
success, people pick up and leave.

3353
02:57:43,720 --> 02:57:46,680
You want an ecosystem 
to gradually develop.

3354
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:51,720
They should've started by putting
 the interests of investors,

3355
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:56,000
venture capitalists and angel 
investors, on top.

3356
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:59,520
Develop laws that would 
save them the shaking.

3357
02:57:59,560 --> 02:58:01,680
- From the public bus joke?
- Yeah.

3358
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:08,240
Our powers that be prioritize maintaining authority
over the interests of investors and the economy.

3359
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:09,680
That's the main issue.

3360
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:11,280
You mean the superior power?

3361
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:14,520
Throughout. It permeates.

3362
02:58:14,560 --> 02:58:17,800
Why do you think no one makes any 
investment deals under Russian law? 

3363
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:21,600
This FRII fund created by the Agency 
for Strategic Initiatives,

3364
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:24,120
only they make deals within 
Russian jurisdiction.

3365
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:25,480
Why is that?

3366
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:30,720
Because no one believes that they could protect
 their business interests under Russian law.

3367
02:58:30,760 --> 02:58:33,280
Even the smallest deals...

3368
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:37,560
Scenario: I work as a sales 
manager for some company.

3369
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:39,040
I have $3000 of free capital.

3370
02:58:39,080 --> 02:58:40,800
My neighbor has a startup.

3371
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:42,640
I wanna give him this money.

3372
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:45,200
I'll be signing this deal
someplace like Cyprus.

3373
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:49,680
I thought people did this 
strictly because of taxes?

3374
02:58:49,720 --> 02:58:52,520
- No! Of course not!
- 'Cause you'd pay less taxes.

3375
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:56,040
Not anymore. They introduced CFC.
You're not dodging shit.

3376
02:58:56,080 --> 02:59:00,160
Russia has small taxes.
 Why try and dodge 13%?

3377
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:01,720
It's 50% over here!

3378
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:04,440
Depends on the tax.
 Russian payroll tax is very high.

3379
02:59:04,480 --> 02:59:09,400
- Payroll tax is, yeah. But you're not gonna 
process wages through Cyprus, are you?
- True.

3380
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:13,800
You use offshore jurisdictions
specifically for investment deals.

3381
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:16,320
Tax optimization costs zilch. 

3382
02:59:16,360 --> 02:59:19,320
It's done specifically 
for English law.

3383
02:59:19,360 --> 02:59:24,080
- Because our courts...
- So in case something happens you go to court 
to the House of Representatives.

3384
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:26,120
- Cyprus uses English law?
- Yes.

3385
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:29,720
One of the reasons the Valley 
emerged where it did

3386
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:33,160
was, paradoxically, the fact that 
this was lawless countryside.

3387
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:36,120
West Coast was quite a bit 
away from East Coast.

3388
02:59:36,320 --> 02:59:38,640
All the big companies 
were on the East Coast.

3389
02:59:38,680 --> 02:59:41,280
They developed electric 
lamps and stuff.

3390
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:47,040
Well, the West Coast cowboys made them too, 
nonchalantly ripping off East Coast technology.

3391
02:59:47,080 --> 02:59:50,640
Lucky for them, enforcing patent law
 across the continent was a tall ask.

3392
02:59:50,680 --> 02:59:55,400
That's why venturous types 
would come and stay here.

3393
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:59,160
They formed a community
 of peculiar personalities.

3394
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:01,160
This community evolved 
and evolved.

3395
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:04,240
The Valley's all about networking.
 That's why it works.

3396
03:00:04,280 --> 03:00:10,040
So the right way to do it wasn't building 
a NEW think tank near Moscow,

3397
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:13,680
but rather building up, again, 
Akademgorodok or some such place

3398
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:17,680
where smart people have been 
living next to each other

3399
03:00:17,720 --> 03:00:20,000
and creating cool things 
for decades?

3400
03:00:20,040 --> 03:00:24,320
Yeah. Especially when this new think tank 
is super state-y and super official,

3401
03:00:24,360 --> 03:00:25,560
official and cool.

3402
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:29,200
You get officials going, 
"I want my son in there!"

3403
03:00:29,240 --> 03:00:31,040
"Now work! I'm paying 
good money here!"

3404
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:33,840
Maybe his son doesn't even want that, 
but he'll go either way.

3405
03:00:33,880 --> 03:00:36,400
Instead you want mavericks.

3406
03:00:36,440 --> 03:00:39,880
- All breakthroughs are made by mavericks,
people who don't fit.
- By what now?

3407
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:42,680
All breakthroughs are made 
by mavericks.

3408
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:44,400
Jobs was a maverick.

3409
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:47,560
Gates is this four-eyed maverick.

3410
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:50,920
- Revolutions are started by people 
who don't fit normal life.
- Not by officials?

3411
03:00:52,440 --> 03:00:56,160
Yeah. People with normal lives don't 
need revolutions. They're fine.

3412
03:00:56,200 --> 03:00:59,040
You wanna build around a university.
It's got academia.

3413
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:04,520
Okay. But if a lousy soft science 
graduate like myself gets it,

3414
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:07,480
how come the guys ruling 
the country didn't get it?

3415
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:11,880
They did. They also knew that once they
 picked an existing akademgorodok 

3416
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:13,960
or some other existing place,

3417
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:18,280
struggle for resource control 
would immediately ensue.

3418
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:21,840
You can't start in MSU.

3419
03:01:21,880 --> 03:01:25,440
That would give the president 
of MSU too much power.

3420
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:28,680
And to Moscow. So it has to be 
outside of Moscow.

3421
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:31,120
You can't start in Novosibirsk 
Akademgorodok,

3422
03:01:31,160 --> 03:01:34,560
because the region's governor 
didn't do enough to deserve it.

3423
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:36,800
It's politics.

3424
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:40,160
Politics is stupid, and I try 
to stay away from it.

3425
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:42,560
It's not just Russia 
that can't copy it.

3426
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:45,520
At this stage, I think 
no other place can.

3427
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:49,840
For better or for worse, this is the place
 where the right conditions coalesced.

3428
03:01:49,880 --> 03:01:54,000
Now this place attracts the kind of people 
that can do all these things.

3429
03:01:54,040 --> 03:01:56,080
Sooner of later, 
they end up here.

3430
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:57,960
And...

3431
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:04,080
If you took 10,000 of the most important 
people here and moved them over to Russia,

3432
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:06,680
that place would probably become 
the new Silicon Valley.

3433
03:02:07,280 --> 03:02:09,560
But that's a tall ask,

3434
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:15,840
'cause this place offers them an environment
 that no other place can compete with.

3435
03:02:17,360 --> 03:02:19,080
'Cause people make the Valley.

3436
03:02:19,120 --> 03:02:22,840
It's not a place. It's not about 
technoparks and pretty offices.

3437
03:02:22,880 --> 03:02:29,360
You could build pretty buildings in Dubai 
or Skolkovo, or anywhere else

3438
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:31,040
and dump a ton of money in it,

3439
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:34,960
but if it doesn't have
 this spirit of: 

3440
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,440
"We fail. We experiment."

3441
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:41,120
"We're okay with doing 
new crazy things,

3442
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:46,120
"and no one's gonna look at us askance, on the contrary, it's encouraged,"

3443
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:49,240
without those things, you can't 
create another Valley.

3444
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:53,440
They'll either produce derivative 
and boring copies of things

3445
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:58,080
or just ideas that aren't 
innovative in any way.

3446
03:02:58,640 --> 03:03:00,680
You can't create something 
like this artificially.

3447
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:04,160
They emerge organically when 
two kinds of people meet,

3448
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:06,720
dreamers and people 
with money.

3449
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:08,880
And both have to feel 
comfortable.

3450
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:10,880
The two want different things.

3451
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:14,560
Dreamers want set of conditions X; 
people with money want Y.

3452
03:03:14,600 --> 03:03:18,200
- Fat cats and nerds?
- Fat cats and nerds. You could say that.

3453
03:03:18,240 --> 03:03:19,880
Nerds and investors.

3454
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:21,960
This place has these things?

3455
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:26,280
Yes, it does. Stanford and Berkeley...

3456
03:03:26,360 --> 03:03:29,160
It has several strong universities 
with great academia.

3457
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:36,200
They produce a constant flow of new... 
nerds, as you called them.

3458
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:41,080
At the same time, this is a nice and comfortable
 enough place for people who've made billions.

3459
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:45,360
So they don't leave to stay in their villas 
in France and instead live here.

3460
03:03:45,600 --> 03:03:51,400
And this constant exchange where 
some nerd could meet a billionaire 

3461
03:03:51,440 --> 03:03:55,200
at some coffee place in Palo Alto 
15 minutes away from their place,

3462
03:03:55,240 --> 03:03:57,000
they both live 15 minutes 
away from it,

3463
03:03:57,040 --> 03:04:02,080
resulting in some sort of exchange of ideas
 and subsequent investment contract,

3464
03:04:02,120 --> 03:04:04,520
that's what makes this 
place so unique.

3465
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:06,040
It's a tiny stretch of land.

3466
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:10,920
You've driven around. 50 miles both ways. 
That's the Valley. It's tiny.

3467
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:15,280
This tiny stretch of land 
generates a GDP

3468
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:17,800
that's comparable to GDPs 
of some countries.

3469
03:04:17,840 --> 03:04:21,040
Could something emerge in Russia
 in the nearest future?

3470
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:23,240
Nearest, no.

3471
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:27,360
I can't see the light at the end 
of the tunnel.

3472
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:30,080
Maybe it's around the corner.

3473
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:36,000
All we can do is look 
to the future with hope.

3474
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:39,240
Imagine that life is a playground.

3475
03:04:39,280 --> 03:04:42,120
Children come out to play.

3476
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:46,720
Some play soccer, others play 
pocketknife games.

3477
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:49,800
You came out holding
a Junior Engineer set.

3478
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:54,000
You like soldering radios.
That's your idea of fun as a kid.

3479
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,640
You have time until sunset.

3480
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:59,920
Mom's gonna call you soon: 
"Andrew! Inside!"

3481
03:04:59,960 --> 03:05:02,320
I come out with my 
Junior Engineer set.

3482
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:03,880
I need a table.

3483
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:06,440
Boys with the football 
need a goal.

3484
03:05:06,480 --> 03:05:08,800
I need a table to sit there
and solder quietly.

3485
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:12,360
I sit at a table, but it's occupied 
by men.

3486
03:05:12,400 --> 03:05:14,560
They're not good or bad. 
Just normal men.

3487
03:05:14,600 --> 03:05:17,880
They're cursing and playing 
dominoes. 

3488
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:23,840
I sit next to them and try doing
 the thing I came out for.

3489
03:05:24,200 --> 03:05:29,400
But they keep elbowing me and taking my 
soldering iron away, stuff like that.

3490
03:05:29,440 --> 03:05:31,600
I have a few options.

3491
03:05:31,640 --> 03:05:36,600
I could give up and just go, 
"Okay, I'm not gonna build this radio."

3492
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:40,240
I could go, "Okay, I'll play 
THEIR game."

3493
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:43,040
I'll learn to play dominoes.
That's what they play at that table.

3494
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:45,040
To hell with the radio.

3495
03:05:45,080 --> 03:05:47,920
I could start fighting 
and locking horns.

3496
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:53,040
That's yet another game. But it's not MY
Junior Engineer game.

3497
03:05:53,280 --> 03:05:54,920
Some do THAT.

3498
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:56,560
But those older men...

3499
03:05:57,080 --> 03:05:59,800
They're older than me.
They've sat there longer than me.

3500
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:04,200
The rules of their game were invented
 long before any of us were around.

3501
03:06:04,240 --> 03:06:05,680
And there's another option:

3502
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:11,440
pick up your set and find a table where 
you can do what you wanted to do.

3503
03:06:11,880 --> 03:06:15,440
You'll build your radio. Might even treat 
the dominoes crowd to some music.

3504
03:06:15,760 --> 03:06:18,240
That's basically what 
happened with me.

3505
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:20,120
I left,

3506
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:23,240
(ending music starts playing quietly)
I did what I wanted 
to do here,

3507
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:25,760
but everyone's enjoying 
the end result.

3508
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:29,440
There's you. There's your channel.
There's Russian YouTube.

3509
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:31,440
People are watching us
at this moment.

3510
03:06:31,480 --> 03:06:33,920
In part, thanks to my work.

3511
03:06:34,520 --> 03:06:36,880
(Dud') Do you think the older men 
will ever scoot over?

3512
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:41,040
(Doronichev) (sighs) I think they'll build
 more tables. I hope so.

3513
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:42,760
Those men need a place 
too, you know?

3514
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:44,280
Someone has to play 
dominoes.

3515
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:46,520
You can't change these 
things by force.

3516
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:51,400
I don't believe you can up and 
re-build something in a jiffy.

3517
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:57,040
You see? In this metaphor, sunset's coming. 
Mom's gonna call you home soon. 

3518
03:06:57,080 --> 03:07:02,360
I only have so many years in my life
 to create something meaningful.

3519
03:07:02,400 --> 03:07:04,360
I can only create something
 I'm good at.

3520
03:07:04,720 --> 03:07:09,680
That's why I'm merely choosing the environment 
that lets me achieve this with maximum efficiency

3521
03:07:09,720 --> 03:07:11,360
and maximum benefit
for everybody.

3522
03:07:11,800 --> 03:07:31,160
(ending music)
